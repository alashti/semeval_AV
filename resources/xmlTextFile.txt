re : massage oil
dear , all ! please read question before you are writing answer ! i was n't asking where i can do massage !!! i asked about oil ! as for second answer - i 'm searching oil for body massage . bought one in canterpoint , there is a small shop near sports shop , and that oil has nice smell , but ! it 's not for making massage to anyone !
re : massage oil
again ... i 'm happy for you that you have oil ?! did you read my question ?! i have a lots of things , but i 'm not writing here about it !!! do n't be stupid , people , read before you write something !!! i have question , need answer directly to this question , not your empty answers about nothing !
re : massage oil
you might be able to find body massage oil in body shop at landmark or city centre , and if they do have it there , its guaranteed to be good for massage , as some places sell duplicates , so watch out as this could cause allergies to the skin . good luck !

how can my boyfriend get me and our baby son a visit visa there ?
how can my boyfriend who currently works for a government office there get me and our baby a visit visa ? how long can we stay there in doha and can we also get married there as well ? can we stay together in his house there ? can you give us advice and the steps to take for getting visa and requirements for marriage there in qatar ? it will be greatly appreciated.thanks in advance
re : how can my boyfriend get me and our baby son a visit ...
boyfriend cant . but as a husband he can apply for visit visa for both of you .
re : how can my boyfriend get me and our baby son a visit ...
yep boyfriend can not sponsor you but if he becomes your husband then he can . .
re : how can my boyfriend get me and our baby son a visit ...
as far as i know you need to show a proof as a marriage certificate when applying as you have to show your proof of relationship .
re : how can my boyfriend get me and our baby son a visit ...
your nationality plays a major role here . coz there r certain citizenships who can get on arrival visas just from the airport on arrival . if u r from one of those countries , u do n't have any problem . just buy the tickets , come down here , get the visa from the airport on arrival but your citizenship ... . !!!!!
re : how can my boyfriend get me and our baby son a visit ...
we want to get married there in qatar once we arrive there . . its this possible ? i was told that he can apply for visit visa for me and our son . . he wants us to get married in qatar
re : how can my boyfriend get me and our baby son a visit ...
dear , why dont you let your boy friend arrange the things for you if he really wants to marry you here . the process would be long and lots of documentations needed . i have a friend who got married here -LRB- no child -RRB- lots of documentation needed and takes long time to get their marriage certificate issued and therefore she had to fly back to her home country waiting for the attestation of the marriage certificate . once it is done , then waiting for family visa to be processed . so get yourself ready for all the process . good luck for your wedding .
re : how can my boyfriend get me and our baby son a visit ...
thanks for your answers but i really would like some help on this . we want to get married in qatar . the fact that we are getting married there is it not proof enough for qatari officials to know that we will be legal and enough requirement for us to stay with my fiance in his house ? we were supposed to get married here in the philippines but he did n't have time for us to set the wedding here . . thanks again !
re : how can my boyfriend get me and our baby son a visit ...
much easier to get a civil married first then apply for the visa , this way you can stay with him legally with no worries at all
is it cheaper to buy new clothes in qatar than pay to transport them over from the uk ?
i begin employment in qatar aug 09 and have just been quoted 1000 to have them flown over . is it worth the hassle of customs or should i buy new ? how do prices compare uk next with qatar next ?
re : is it cheaper to buy new clothes in qatar than pay to ...
since u specifically about next then the prices r the same ... except that here u dont get everything u find over in the uk but we do have most of the british stores.we have debanhams , m & s , bhs and next.but over all 1000 is way to much to pay ... depending on how much clothes you have ... or need ... i would humbly suggest that u evaluate yr clothes because u know the prices , u alone will be able to judge if the money will buy u what u decide to leave behind ... good luck
re : is it cheaper to buy new clothes in qatar than pay to ...
i 'm kinda particular about and partial to my clothing so i brought mine . the choices here are not infinite and there is n't the catelog shopping available either .
re : is it cheaper to buy new clothes in qatar than pay to ...
if you already have clothes then it 's infinitely cheaper to bring them than to buy more !
re : is it cheaper to buy new clothes in qatar than pay to ...
i would just want to reiterate that prices are much higher here . for example yesterday in m & s looked at a pair of trousers , uk price 29.50 , qatar price 200qr , which means about 38 sterling at the current rates . next i have found to be even worse than this . at another shop bought my son some clarks sandles costing 245qr which would have been 30 in the uk . talk about mark up ! i would also say that the range of clothing to the average uk taste is quite limited . as soon as you go outside of the uk shops you can run into some rather ornate clothing . the quality can be questionable aswell . not sure how the higher end international shops compare . i am currently counting down the days til i go back to the uk in the summer and hit the summer sales ! planning on going with empty cases and coming back with rather full ones lol .
can we resign from the job ??
my employer have recruited me as a business development executive in a labor visa.i am put on a impossible task.i want to resign from the job.can i do that ??
have u signed any contract ?
have u signed any contract ? if u have , check what is stipulated there . . sometimes , employers require the employee to pay a certain amount of fee if he/she resigns before the probationary period , but you did n't mention how long you 've been working with the company . .
yes , everbody has the right to resign ...
the problem is ... expenses
like getting banned for 2
like getting banned for 2 years > is that right ?
you can resign and go back

anyone knows where the best to sell or trade cars here in doha ?
i was thinking of trading or selling my car . in case i want to trade it , where is the best trading company ? as well as to where to sell it ?
re : anyone knows where the best to sell or trade cars ...
best place is qatarliving ofcourse
re : anyone knows where the best to sell or trade cars ...
u r already in the best place ... advertize here in ql
re : anyone knows where the best to sell or trade cars ...
it might take awhile to sell a dodge car nowadays and if you are looking for a best sell place i do n't suggest you to park your car in one of those car shops at salwa roads , it take awhile to be noticed , so your best bet to find car showrooms inside doha or add your car at http://qatarsale.com by contacting them and they will do the rest
re : anyone knows where the best to sell or trade cars ...
try these sites , www dot qatarsale dot com and www dot qatarcl dot com ... good luck
re : anyone knows where the best to sell or trade cars ...
approach oasis used cars . . they are the best . location near crazy signal dial 111 to get the contact number .
re : anyone knows where the best to sell or trade cars ...
salwa road has a lot of cars showrooms also . let me tell you something , if you like adventures just go to industrial area - street no. 10 , on thursdays and fridays :-RRB- , you will find your self in cars souq alot of cars , alot of people :-RRB- . . but if u go there and you was upset . . its not my fault : -RRB-
re : anyone knows where the best to sell or trade cars ...
which car do you have ?
my doubt
i would like to know some information from you all . suppose someone came here under visit visa and extended it up to six month . then after six month he went , my doubt is that , how many moths should he wait to come here again after . can he come here again within one month under a new visit visa ?
twinkle twinkle little star
come on all just clear out my doubt
the person
should have been under family sponsorship . thats the only visa i think which is extensible upto 6 months . anyways , the person has to wait 3 months to come back .
after three months .
after three months .
living up to the reputation bond and others have given me
moths will not help you being here at all . they are fluttery creatures that destroy cloth . i doubt any moth will help you at all . to be puerile though and living up to the persona some have created for me on ql . i will say this , ca n't answer your question as i do n't have a problem with travel as i am english and as much as we are ` hated ' by some we can travel anywhere we like .
is there any temple in qatar ... .
hi , as most indians live in qatar ... is there any temple in qatar ...
re : is there any temple in qatar ... .
http://www.qatarliving.com/answers/living-in-qatar/any-hindu-temple write temple on the search at the right hand side u will find many threads on this topic ... ... ...
re : is there any temple in qatar ... .
qatar is basically an islamic country and they see asian expats as slaves and nothi8ng more . so u may see churches here but you wont find temples . and idol worship is not allowed in islam . hence you wont find temples here . i hope one day qatar changes the attitude of seeing asians as slaves .
re : is there any temple in qatar ... .
shayampsundar ... . . you are prejudiced against qatar ... ... . . why not you leave this country if your religious sentiments are being bashed ... as you claim !! asians are slave ??????????? are you treating yourself as a leader of again community here . beware such statements can lead to your deportation also ... . . i know you are still a kid -LRB- based on your profile -RRB- ... . but refrain from unworthy comments ... . otherwise this would lead to problem for your parents who are earning their livelihood here and feeding you !!!
re : is there any temple in qatar ... .
shyam sunder ... are they treating u as a slave or do u consider yourself to be a rotten slave ... coz i do not think that any one here has bothered to chain ur legs to some shackles here and kept u bonded ... u are here just for your some meaningful gains and u are making yourself a slave to the country . . like any respect a human being deserves everyone has the freedom to choose to stay or go away from a place he likes or dislikes ... so if u do not like the systems here y the hell are u making urself a slave or a dog over here ... get lost man to ur own country and iam sure wherever u go u will definitely treat others as slaves . . so cheers
re : is there any temple in qatar ... .
shayampsundar , u have the right to speak out and give ur comment or suggestion but u should respect qatar or the relegion islam!by giving comments to ur brother ... if somebody treated u as slave do n't generalized all the locals or qatari/we all know most indians was lazy and trying hard/they think that they know everything but we know that their really something/talkative and staburn ...
who is the best hijacker here in ql ?

re : rolex watch
go to 51 east -LRB- either in city centre or in al maha near jarir -RRB- . they are the agents of rolex and will have technicians .
re : rolex watch
as aby said these are motion watches ... .
re : rolex watch
rolex agent is modern home , u must take advice from them , according to advice u have to take dession . secundly your watch is not aut . best of luck .
re : rolex watch
this is a common finding when first starting to use a rolex ... i panicked when i first got mine and took it back to the dealer as it stopped as i took it off over night the first time i got it ... wear it on for a few days then it wont stop if u leave it overnight but it would stop if u leave it for a couple of days though ... enjoy it

i enjoy the marriott spa
i enjoy the marriott spa massage a lot . and often go to ritz carleton in the cookies of life , friends are the chocolate chips
hi
so you are looking for a message !!! hmmmm i dont recommend any one of them , i went once and i was going to xxxxx with that semi guy , they all are shemales belive me , so if u r looking for that go ahead otherwise there is the only one who is the decent at al saad street , it is after al saad plaza if you are coming from the new traffic light near the bmw , it is called kotakel something like that . good luck
we share similar interests .
good facial centres/spas , try marriott or ritz , they have a lovely spa , but expensive . a new place opened up opp city centre , its called bio something.they too specialise in the same stuff.again expensive . lady siam centre near toys r us , alsadd area , is good too.they specialise in thai massages and stuff and their facial is really nice and soothing . had it long time back , but communiacting with them is difficult as they speak only thai and broken english . massage , you can try chinese reflexology massage at ramada , that good too , also the kottakal massage centre in muntaza area , cheap and good for body pains and stuff.both are priced at aprox 100qrs . almost all saloons do facials and some have real extensive range of facials.u need to try out the places to get a feel of it . i just saw your profile , you sound so much like me , except the coke and margarita part .
lady message
hi all is there any phillipino lady makes good message in home either for men or for women . . kindly send mail to killer_mllr@yahoo.com with the charges to be mentioned also . . thanks ... ... ... ...

lady siam
the massage itself is ok , not excellent , but ok . the overall experience is not the best - can never reach them on the phone , the receptionist is not very friendly , not punctual . another words if you are looking for the experience , this is not the place to go .
philippino massage

hi all , my wife is nearly to give birth and i am wondering which is the best clinic/hospital in qatar , some people are considering that hamad is the best other al ahly other clinic al doha ... please can you share with us your idea and experience and give us advice . thanks in advance
even if you go to al ahli
even if you go to al ahli after delivery you will be referred to hamad for further proceedings ... birth certificate , immunization etc. . better go to hamad inshallah everything will be fine ... to go to ahli is to simply increase your expenses ...

as i understand hamad is a

you will only pay 100 qr per
you will only pay 100 qr per day in hamad . . that 's all . . everything is free . . even if c-section is going to be performed only room charge 100 qr/day is going to be paid by the patient . . the shorter she stays in hamad the cheaper it gets ... my wife delivered our third baby in 2010 in hamad ... now even if i have axa insurance i will still consider hamad when my wife delivers our next baby in 3 weeks from now . . that is because i am very much satisfied with hamad ... best service at lowest cost ...
hamad hosp will charge 200 qr
hamad hosp will charge 200 qr per day for visit visa pregnant women who will deliver their babies ... check hamad women 's hospital for more info ...

simangot , i suggest your gf switch to smart sim in pinas . i will tell you some encouragement and ideas . and advantages and disadvantages of both globe and smart . here it goes : with smart , you dont have to load everyday or every week just to maintain your sim or be activated . you can do smartload or over the air reload once in 3 months . the sim will be deactivated within 120 days of no load . 1 peso text from pinas to internatioal roaming sim . smart signal is also good in doha . in industrial area is good , why not in the city . :-RRB- with globe , you have to maintain a load everytime for the rest of your life in abroad . much expensive . with smart , when activated as roaming sim , pure text only . while globe , you can receive/make calls but it 's expensive . international rate charges apply . if you happen to buy that globe ofw sim , it 's a bull ! they said on the tv commercials that no maintaining balance for 1 year or forever , i dont remember anymore . it 's not true ! you still have to reload within 1 month of use . i guess you are working here in doha , right ? i bet you talk to your gf at night or after work or in the morning . why do n't you buy qtel sim from qtel offices . it 's only 50qr now , i think they still have this promo going on . or better yet , there is this internet calls located in doha . maybe its in souq or industrial area . 1 minute is to 1qr . cheaper than using your qtel sim to call pinas for 1.85 qr per minute .
globe family sim pack comes
globe family sim pack comes with 1pc ofw preactivated roaming sim and 2pcs family sim sold at php120 .00 only available at designated retail outlets in the philippines . u would easily find it while processing some of ur papers at poea ortigas . family sim can text and call the ofw sim at a cost of philippine local standard sms and calling charges . the ofw sim remains still active even at a zero load balance while abroad provided , however , any of the family sim must use the facility of sms or calling at a time not exceeding within a month period . anyhow , anyone of the family sim dont have any sms or calling activity within a month to an ofw sim , the service shall be automatically deactivated . likewise , the ofw sim lost its special service capabilities . the ofw sim will be then regarded as ordinary sim . >
why stick to globe ? a lots
why stick to globe ? a lots of smart roaming sim is available in souq area . electronic loading is also available there . eof0825
how is gulf driving school ?
i want to take a driving classes from gulf driving school as it is near to my flat . can anyone suggest me the popularity of this school ?
re : how is gulf driving school ?
it 's popular with guys living near your flat .
re : how is gulf driving school ?
most of people prefer karwa driving school . as registration process is swift . i heard from my fellas there is some offerfor full course , but your enrollment will come after 1 month .
re : how is gulf driving school ?
gulf driving school offers the best chance of you getting your licence among all the driving schools . it is popular because of the high success rate . the teaching however is terrible . so if you really want to learn driving , go to some other place . if you just want the licence , you can try gulf driving school

walking in doha
hi this might be a bit of an odd question but can you walk from the japanese embassy or the kempinski hotel to city centre shopping centre ? it looks definitely walkable distance-wise but do the roads preclude any chance of walking ?
noo its very unsafe
u have dodge bullets bombs and air strikes
i see a lot of people are
i see a lot of people are walking in city centre area in the evenings and weekends . they park their cars all around w , kempinski , and stuff , and just walk . . it 's not really safe , as there are no sidewalks in doha , but as i said , i see many people do it . . life is unsafe in general . . so . .

general tier 1 migrant visa to uk
hi ladies and gentlemen , i would like to know if any one has experience applying for uk visa general tier 1 that allows u to work in uk . please ur advise is v important .
i happen to know first
i happen to know first hand . . factors such as age , education and earnings for the past 12 mths of the applicant will be alloted ` points ' and if he/she meets the minimum points for this visa category then its not a problem at all . you will have to apply from outside the uk for this , even if you are currently residing there under a different visa category . what do you want to know specifically ? ~ live like there 's no tommorrow ~
thanks for your reply pin ,
thanks for your reply pin , have u applied before for this type of visa ? i would like to know how easy i can be accepted and how long it takes to know if i will be granted this visa . . please advise
yes , i have been working and
yes , i have been working and living in london for more than 1 year under a highly skilled migrant programme -LRB- hsmp -RRB- and i subsequently switched to tier 1 -LRB- general -RRB- . bear in mind - i got my visa way before the uk recession and jobs were easy to come by . now unemployment is a big issue here . you wo n't be able to renew the tier 1 visa without a skilled job . anyways , it is unlawful to reject your application if you : - 1 -RRB- have met the minimum 75 points 2 -RRB- can proof that you meet the required english standard 3 -RRB- have minimum funds of gbp2800 . 4 -RRB- obviously , you must not have any prior criminal convictions or have previously abused your immigration status -LRB- i.e. overstayed on a visa , outstanding fines in uk , etc -RRB- do n't bother applying if you do n't meet the above . for me , application to approval took 3 weeks , applying from kl , malaysia . for precise requirements and how points are calculated , see http://www.ukvisas.gov.uk/en/howtoapply/infs/inf21pbsgeneralmigrant#6375036 good luck . ~ live like there 's no tommorrow ~
am so lucky to have your advice
i am so lucky to have your advice , knowing that u went through the same procedures before . what do u mean `` you wo n't be able to renew the tier 1 visa without a skilled job '' . actually i am not renewing , and do they gauge their approval by the required profession on top of the ones u mentioned . did u validate ur degrees with naric , any advice here ? must be the bank statement not older than 7 days or it is fine to be a bit older ? i have applied toefle for more than 5 years ago , do they take this into consideration ? please advise , thanks v much indeed
no probs . .
the tier 1 general visa is for 24 months only . to extend your stay beyond 24 months you must renew it . you wo n't be able to do so without a job . as far as i know , you must have at least a bachelor 's degree and that 's how they accept that you are ` highly skilled ' . they want original documents , no copies . do n't worry they will return these to you . bank statements - latest 3 months showing minimum of gbp2800 and must be original as well . toefl is accepted , marks must be 110-120 -LRB- internet based test -RRB- . you must also provide the original cert and test scores . ~ live like there 's no tommorrow ~
one more query
do u think that they accept notarized copy of my certificates and not original ones ? is it possible to get ur email for future correspondence ? thanks so much , you have been v helpful to me
thanks so much for ur reply ,
greatly appreciated
can anyone help me !
can anyone advice me about my kids , ca n't sleep for whole night.they will start to sleep at 6am
re : can anyone help me !
i recommend buying them melatonin . i started using it 3 weeks ago . i get sleepy soon after taking 2 and i have a great sleep . i do n't wake up with that lingering tiredness that something like , say , panadol night , does . the pharmacy opposite carrefour in villagio definitely has it for about qr36 and i 'm sure you 'll find it at other pharmacies -LRB- no prescription needed of course -RRB- . best of luck !

re : can anyone help me !
dont let them sleep for a day in the morning.at night they will fall asleep.continue this for a week.they will get used.don ' t ever change the sheddule time.put them on bed on time.let them be entertained during day time.and not allow at night . if they are toddlers they usually dose ` nt want to sleep.they try to experience the surroundings.make them to understand that night is to sleep or rest.don ' t use lights which are bright.try not to use or a very mild power.don ' t encourage them at night to talk/play/have snacks . . etc.so they 'll feel the night boaring and they automatically go to sleep . try some bedtime stories.give them a bed time and never ever change it.be stricked on the rule.i think it will work out surely .

qmiles for sale
'm aware that qmiles transfer fee is us $ 15 per 1,000 qmiles . -LRB- online transfer -RRB- could you kindly give me an idea how much i can sell my 100,000 qmiles . many thanks .
re : qmiles for sale
the cost of buying 1000 qmiles directly from qatar airways is qr 120 . you should accept no less than qr 80 per 1000 . many people would want to spend money on transfer , rather they want you to go with them to the qatar airways office to permit the use of the qmiles you agreed on , they will pay you the agreed amount , and pay qatar airways the taxes and other fees .

are there any companies in qatar that hire out baby furniture and car seats ?
we are moving to qatar but shipping of all our belongings wo n't arrive for nearly 5 weeks after we do . we ca n't decide if it 's best to pay excess bagage and bring items like child port-a-cot and car seat with us or put in shipping . is there a company in qatar that do short term hiring out of items including cots , car seats , high chairs etc ?
re : are there any companies in qatar that hire out baby ...
i saw the same in lulu / carrefour
re : are there any companies in qatar that hire out baby ...
hi airlines will not charge you extra for a car seat and travel cot . i have travelled the uk , south africa and switzerland and i have always been able to take my stroller , car seat and travel cot with me at no extra charge . phone the airline and find out !
re : are there any companies in qatar that hire out baby ...
definitely phone the airline . the baggage rules have changed a lot and we nearly got stung for us $ 525 for three bags earlier this month . as recently as october 2008 you could fly from the u.s. to doha on qatar airways without the carseats counting toward your baggage requirement at all . in other words , you were allowed two bags per passenger ... so if there were two adults and two -LRB- paying -RRB- kids then you were allowed eight bags plus the two car seats . but no longer ... now you would be allowed six bags plus two car seats . anything over that costs us $ 175 * per bag * . we learned this the hard way , so it 's not an urban legend for us : -LRB-
re : are there any companies in qatar that hire out baby ...
oh - and to answer your question -LRB- sorry ` bout that ! -RRB- i am not aware of any companies that hire them out . car seats , in particular , are generally not used outside of the expatriate crowd . :-LRB- you can find what you need at the city center babyshop store , but depending on your luggage situation it might just make sense to bring it with you .

another question about sponsorship
hypothetically speaking : if a wife that arrived on husband 's sponsorship gets a job , and wants to leave that job for another better paying job , can she do it without any restricions ?
if the wife is under the
if the wife is under the sponsorship of his husband he can freely tranfer to any company .
she
can she works with gov under her husband sponsring as well ?
the only restriction is courtesy ,
better to follow the terms in the labor law regarding terminating a contract by either party .
well , it 's a bit more complex
well , it 's a bit more complex than that . if she gets a job that allows her to stay under her husband 's sponsorship she can change without an noc . some jobs require you be under their sponsorship . mandi

greek embassy
wheres the greek embassy in doha ? contact details would be appreciated ... thanks ! : -RRB-
re : greek embassy
consular services for greek nationals cyprus embassy in doha is represents the consular interests and diplomatic protection of greek nationals who live and work in qatar since there is no greek embassy in the country . greek nationals can certify documents , signatures and ask for a permanent resident certificate . the price for the certifications is 5 -LRB- around qr40 depending on exchange rate -RRB- also cyprus embassy keeps a mailing list where greeks and cypriots who live and work in qatar are encouraged to register . the mailing list is updated daily and every effort is made for the best accuracy . the embassy distributes security information when necessary and other important information to the registered nationals . the greek ambassador to qatar is the ambassador of greek embassy in kuwait . since cyprus has not started issuing shengen visas yet , visa applications for greece are being processed by the embassy of france . for more information please contact the consular section of the embassy . check this link , http://www.mfa.gov.cy/mfa/embassies/embassy_doha.nsf/all/85d1b7b79ab8fffe432571d4002e8729?opendocument

re : greek embassy
the first answer is outdated - it should be deleted . there is a greek embassy in qatar and its hours are 10-12 daily except fridays . location opposite the doha exibition center . if you are driving from city center and make a u-turn at the doha exibition center round about . in about 400 meters make a right turn . once you made the right , follow through - maybe the second right and another right till you see some vans belonging to a construction office . you will find the greek embassy close to them . 412 8150 greek embassy phone number
employment band
help !! who is imposing a 2 yrs band?company or immigration?like in my case i resigned from work , my visa is expired but the company gave me a release , if i will go back to my country will i have an employment band ??? and needs to wait for 2 yrs to finish to enter doha again ?
re : employment band
from what i know , you will be ban from qatar if your employment did not give a release and you will have to wait for at least two years to go back to qatar .
re : employment band
if you get the no objection certificate from current sponsor u can enter in doha with valid visa
re : employment band
your sponsor can ban you for lifetime ,5 years and minimum 2 years . this 2 year ban is by govt.it is common for anybody who cancel rp and went out.more than 2 yrs ban your sponsor have to show solid reason to mini of interior and it is very hard for employers . now if you want to return before 2 years , noc is requried from old sponsor.if you carry noc with you at time of dept , it need to be endorsed by immigration and this endorsement will expire automaticaly after 6 months.in that case your new employer have to get another one to get your new visa . but wait , , , , , , , which visa are you?some type of visa does not need 2 years bar .
re : employment band
if u hv noc u can come , make sure you get ur rp cancelled by your current company before leaving , make sure you have not crossed 3 months of expiry of rp . why do n't you get sponsorship changed since u have release . good luck !!!
re : employment band
actually my papers are in the labor dept. we are applying for my change of sponsorship we were rejected twice , the reason is the immigration imposed a new rule that company sponsorship transferred to husband sponsorship are not allowed or vice versa . . now my visa is expired and i need to go back home that 's why i am asking if i will go back home will i be able to come back here in qatar after my 2 months vacation , by the way i have my noc w / me and release paper from my previous company .

i am not sure if there is any penalty but they tell you if you dont collect within 30 days the number plate is scrapped and you will have to pay for the plates again , i think its 250 qar for two . but try to go back to the traffic department just incase your plate is still there you can say you went out on holidays or so . . just give it a shot ...

there is no penalty but you have to apply again for a new plate .

bringing books from sharjah to qatar
dear qlers , can you please advise how i can bring some books from dubai to qatar books belong to physiotherapy used books for my reference . appreciate your kind guidance . 5-6 books only
re : bringing books from sharjah to qatar
many thanks for your valued support but as usual books are heavy around 8-9 kgs total . if i use postal am sure i will end up paying a huge charges any other alternative . .
re : bringing books from sharjah to qatar
well , then i guess you could check and see who is coming to qatar from dubai , and request them to get the books for you . but to be honest , i do n't think anyone would be willing to fill in 8-9 kgs of their own luggage space , just to get books for someone else ! , thinkin this way , you might find the shipment option more helpful ! you might have to do a little homework on checking out which shipment companies gives you the best price , and instruct the seller/sender accordingly :-RRB- alternately , try looking for those books in qatar , i.e. in jarir bookstore .
re : bringing books from sharjah to qatar
ani chy has given you the right answer . if you dont want to spend money on shipping charges you should find someone who is coming from u.a.e and also willing to take you 9kg load free of charge but most probably a very difficult way .

about resignation ?
one of my friend is working here in qatar for 4 years , he is planning to resign and go back to his country of origin.he was asking does the company will give any seperation pay?if yes , how is it to be computed?lenght of service or whatsoever ?
re : about resignation ?
gratuity -40 days of basic salary he will get , since he worked 4 years .
re : about resignation ?
per qatar labor laws : 21 days basic salary is gratuity for each year worked . 4 year * 21 days * last daily basic pay = gratuity amount
re : about resignation ?
1-calculation of gratuity as per qatar labor law is 21 days basic salary of each year . if u worked 5 years or more it will become 1 month basic salary instead of 21 days . 2 . each year u have a right to get 21 days leave salry , if u not get in previous years , u can claim for this also . 3 . all of the calculation based on the last basic salary u got . eg . suppose on the time of ur joining ur basic salary is 5000 and now u r getting the basic salary 7500 , the calculation is based on the last one measns 7500 . 4 . if ur contract is defenit contract u should give 2 weeks notice informing ur resignation . if ur contact is indefinit duration contact u must give 1 month notice about ur resignation . other wise they can deduct 1 month salary or remaining balance of days salary from ur settlement .
re : about resignation ?
he will get only gratuity that 21 days per year as per the last drawn basic , apart from that legally nothing

re : is 2750 qr gon na be enough ?
hello queenritz ! although the accommodation and transportation is provided , the offer is really lame and you 'll see that wo n't be enough for your monthly expenses . good luck !
re : is 2750 qr gon na be enough ?
if you spend it moderately then , 750qr is enough for the whole month food and other expense . you can save upto 2000qr , if you spend the money correctly .

very bad offer , keep trying better luck next time .

re : is 2750 qr gon na be enough ?
2750 is too much for you . tell the management to reduce salary range 1500 to 1750 , then they will definitely agree with you and you should think that teaching profession is not for money , its a charity too ...
re : is 2750 qr gon na be enough ?
it would be enough but not satisfactory . just do your job very well and soon you can ask for an increase . regards

is 14500 qar good salary
hi all , i got a job offer from qatar they are offering me 14500 per month and 4000 bonus that would be paid quarterly . this is way more than what i get in india . but do you think this is a good salary in qatar . i am married and my wife would join me.how much would i be able to save on average a month . thank you in advance .
re : is 14500 qar good salary
14,500 is a good salary and the bonus is a plus , u will be paying the rent per month for a 2 bedroom fully furnished apartment between 7000 to 8000 qr , around 300 for water and electricity bills , then monthly budget for groceries approx . 1000 to 1500 . so all in all maximum 10,000 qr , so will be saving around 5,000 qr at least.u can save more depending on the life style u choose . life in qatar is good , peaceful , free of worries . so do n't worry take a chance , its a good opportunity .
re : is 14500 qar good salary
you can find 1bhk semi furnished brand new flats including water and electricity in doha at qrs 3500-4000 per month . grocery , 1000 - 1500 qrs . petrol and other maintenances , 300-500 if you have an economy car in good condition . telephone and internet , 250-500 . so total monthly expense will come around 6500 - 7000 maximum . you can save half of your salary if you have a good plan . good luck go ahead this is a good job offer if the company and project is real .
re : is 14500 qar good salary
for single it is okay . but for married you wo n't be saving anything . 1000-1500 living expenses is good for one person only . house rent and food will eat most of your salary . transportation or car maintenance and education fees is an additional burden to your meagre salary .
re : is 14500 qar good salary
thanks for your inputs.felt this is a good salary by asian standards .
re : is 14500 qar good salary
i dont see anybody died here with a salary of 1000qr ... depends on your lifestyle ...
re : is 14500 qar good salary
yes it 's more than good and you do n't have a family so easily you can pay your home rent and your car car payments , the rest of your salary you can do some shopping and spend a good time with friends
car transfer
one of my friend is on visit visa in qatar , he got permanent qatari driving license , can he buy car on his name though he dont have residence visa ?
re : car transfer
how did he get a qatari driving license -LRB- permanent -RRB- without having a residence permit and id ?
re : car transfer
cherukkan , he might have got the temporary dl and is confused . they will not issue permanent dl without rp and id . a person on visit visa will not have a permanent dl of qatar and will not be able to buy a car .
re : car transfer
please get your facts straight as you can not get a permanent drivers license without an rp . the license is link to your qid and bear the same number .
re : car transfer
the license is connected to the qatari id . . if the visa is cancelled the license will have no meaning as well . . he is driving at his own risk similar to not having a license . . if he gets a new sponsor and gets a new qatari id he will again need to apply for a new license to be linked to that new id .
re : car transfer
dohamarketing is right . you do n't need a driving license to buy a car but you need an rp to buy a car . his driving license is invalid as his visa was cancelled and he should renew it after obtaining the rp .

there are too many gift offers by some awesome skincare brands like http://www.dermology.us/ and http://www.defensesoap.com/ in this christmas . i got one and presented it to my mother . this can be an option as women are most likely to appreciate it .

i have found that atkins in qatar is really difficult ... i lost over 50kgs on it and kept it off for 3 years -LRB- including 2.5 years in qatar -RRB- - then about 2 years ago , i just could n't contain myself with all the good food - hummous , arabic bread , naan , butter chicken ... etc. . . techincally , i should n't have had a much of a problem - you can eat kebab with rocket leaves and onions - or in salad - chicken does n't have to be your only option . brunch at a hotel on sundays is brilliant - berries , eggs and turkey/beef bacon , sausages , meat - thats all allowed . what about making a smoothie of cream , berries and ice ? omelettes with mushrooms , greem peppers , diced chicken and cheeze ... there are lots of choices ... have you seen this ... http://www.atkins.com/program/low-carb-online-tools.aspx there is a tab that will take you to meal plans and recipes ... try it :--RRB- you have just inspired me to start again ...

i was/am on atkins quite frequently and lost weight also . but i found some problems like getting hyper on staff/customers , not been able to talk much etc etc. so i dont observe atkins regularly . may be two weeks on atkins and then break for some days/week and then again on atkins . yes atkins certainly helped me in loosing weight . foods you can include -LRB- apart from chicken -RRB- is eggs -LRB- all type -RRB- , zero cola , bottle gourd , egg plant , okra , cheese , fish , tuna , salads . one thing more is >> > lime juice once in day -LRB- especially in morning before food -RRB- . this is not recommended in atkins coz of bit high in carb but it help in making your food balance to more alkaline compared to acidic food .

re : can we bring our 40 days old baby with out a visa .
you surely need a visa and since your wife is working in hamad she can bring the baby on her sponsership .
re : can we bring our 40 days old baby with out a visa .

well it is not possible to get your baby without a valid visa as you know now there are provisions for a passport to be made for a new born .
re : can we bring our 40 days old baby with out a visa .
yes dear , you can bring your baby without a visa upto 90 days old but with a valid passport.subjected your wife 's visa is still active . . after entering to qatar you have to process residense visa within one month . you need , birth certificate -LRB- attested by minstry of foreign affairs and qatar consulate in your country -RRB- , sponsors -LRB- your wife -RRB- visa and id copies , bank statements -LRB- 3mnths -RRB- , residential contract copy , attested degree certificates -LRB- rarely asks -RRB- and of course photographs of baby . since your wife is not under your sponsorship , before proceeding check with her sponsor for additional requirements.good luck .
re : can we bring our 40 days old baby with out a visa .

my wife is on these supplements for low stomach acid , she has not joined me out here yet , but we were going to get them sent from the uk as we were n't sure if they are available here . it might be worth trying the internet if you have a po box that they can be sent to , when my wife ran out of them she found it helpful to eat an orange with a meal as this does increase the stomachs ability to break down the fats . do n't use a lemon as these turn alkiline in the stomach and make the problem worse . good luck

can anyone recommend a painter ?
the painter that our compound mgmt sent over was clearly gouging us - he wanted 1,500 qr per room , which is more than it would cost in the u.s. . . . and i know the guys here are making much much less than the immigrant labor in texas . any recommendations for someone who will do a good job for a fair price ? thanks , expat sueo
painting is very easy and a
painting is very easy and a fun job to do . you can buy the paint at any jotun shop , where they will mix it by computer to any shade you want . then get some rollers and do it yourself . you will save a lot of money and you will feel so much better after you have completed the job . really rewarding . i love painting my house and have done everything myself . aisha-taweela
200qr
is what we spent for each room . they are more than ripping you off . we went to jotun -LRB- there is one in the same place as party kingdom near jaidah flyover -RRB- and bought the paint there and contracted with one of their workers . he would come over at night after his regular job was done . this was somewhat inconvenient , but he was good and cheap !
thanks , aisha-taweela & deedee
i ended up finding someone to paint the three rooms for 1,000 qr . it 's more than 200/room , but he paints for a number of people in the compound and brings his own supplies . i need to scurry on over to pick up the paint tomorrow ! cheers , expat sueo
haha kamranhassan !
do n't let me fool you ... i 'm blessed by plenty of bad luck as well . i have more `` strange bad luck stories '' than you could possibly imagine !
expat sueo .
dear , than you should close to god always pray for your luck . its doest not matter . i do n't know anything about luck . i 've never banked on it , and i 'm afraid of people who do . luck to me is something else ; hard work and realizing what is opportunity and what is n't / when the good luck comes - ready to receive it . always count yourself in lucky persons . . thanks
you were right on , speed
the person who came did it for 1,000 qr and did a fantastic job . the guy who wanted to do it for 4,500 must have been smoking something !
u r
alwyas count ur life with smiles ...
deedee
do u have phone number for guy who done ur painting , pm me thanks
painting cost is a tricky issue
the 200 and the 1500 sound logical . it really depends on the extent of work . it could be simple painting and applying one or two layers of normal paint . it could be also a complicated task which involve scraping , priming then doing several layers of paint . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = http://www.qatarliving.com/node/58409

`` driving a vehicle loaded in such a way that it cause damage to people and surroundings '' - this usually means speeding and it is caught by the radar at traffic lights if you cross the speed limit for that road . you can go to traffic dept at old airport or madinat khalifa and request to see a video of the violation . ur dad can tell if its his car and move accordingly . the place zones can often be misleading due to error in data entry . but timing will be accurate , only our minds play tricks on timings . worth checking out the video than speculating .

its happened with me once and they mention that driving a car which is above 50 meters or the level allowd in website and when i checked in arabic then i find out its a seat belt panelty ... when they enter in there system at traffic dept they enter in arabic and then system is translating in silly enligh option which is enterd already from there side at traffic dept. .

re : can i work in qatar under my fathers sponsorship ?
technically you ca n't work under your father 's sponsorship but you can transfer your sponsorship to whichever employer even if your employer does not have a visa of your specific nationality , its easier that way but if and when you do a transfer , you have to be careful because specific nationalities such as jordanian for instance can be denied a transfer in which case you may end up in trouble ...

check many other channels to confirm news -LRB- like investigating history -RRB- or discovery channel ... personally i feel al jazeera show directly from horse mouth and do n't involve personal commentaries on the subject ... from india most reliable is ndtv , times now and headlines today ... international news ... bbc , cnn ... pakistan geo
love al jazeera
i like al jazeera in arabic , like fox is a propaganda machine for u.s right wing al-jazeera is a propanganda machine , i never heard about domestic issues of arab world properly in al jazeera . so i love the arabic version escipially the advertisments which is a big relief .
lusitano ... authoritarian channels suck !
i was mainly referring to regional channels , do n't know about the rest of the world 's local news channels . but imagine having to put up with 20 minutes of listing the names of every single member at the leader 's reception ! oh , and of course all internal affairs are good and satisfactory . . :-RRB- salam

insha'allah , happy happy
i think they will grow and mature . but if they want to be viewed as anything but an anti-western mouthpiece they will need watch their editorial bias . fox does n't care about such things and is happy to be seen as the right wing network it is . i would hope that a-j does n't follow that same path . they are positioned -LRB- and funded -RRB- to make great contributions international media . unfortunately , as long as they allow someone 's politics to color their reporting , they will be marginalized . i think you get the best sense of what 's going on by watching a lot of different news . i watch bbc , cnn , aje , and msnbc . i even occasionally fox so i can see what the enemy is up to :--RRB- <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> <strong> i refuse to drink the kool-aid ! </strong> -- <em> pm </em> </p>

you said it all indeed ! specially the last paragraph , i keep thinking what is a 100 % objective coverage ? there will always be two sides of any story . i think the bbc is the most objective , but i have to watch cnn and one arab channel -LRB- al-jazeera or al-arabia -RRB- to make sure im not mislead . salam

how to go by road ?
me and my friends are planning to take a trip to dubai by car this eid . my questions are : 1 . where can we get visa to dubai ? 2 . i presume we also need transit visa in ksa , how can we get it and how much would this cost ? 3 . any special permit for our car if we take it from doha ? thanks for your help .
re : how to go by road ?
i think that you might have left it a bit late . . as you will travelling through saudi arabia to uae then you require a transit visa . normally ksa embassy here in qatar stop issuing transit visa about two weeks before the eid . . the rest of the trip is not worth mentioning if youhave not this first step . .
re : how to go by road ?
it is too late now tess ; plan in advance minimum 2 weeks for next eid ; give me a pm and i will provide the detail including maps , distance in kms , etc. .
re : how to go by road ?
its too late now you should ask for visa atleast before 15 days

rasha , ask yourself , `` why
rasha , ask yourself , `` why does dubai have all the things qatar does n't ?

confused by spelling comment
qatbrit has used the right ` their ' and ` there ' in her message - have i missed something ??! having just visited a number of schools in qatar i was very much impressed with the importance placed on learning the 3 ` rs in primary school . i know for a fact in the uk that in british schools the spelling is appalling - teachers do n't want to correct mistakes just in case the feelings of the child are knocked !! i personally found doha college to be way above its station - unable to respond to emails requesting a visit and then when they did , they could not arrange a whole school visit requiring us to visit twice if we wanted to see both primary and secondary . i will not bother - i can not imaging how they would deal with a case of bullying if a whole school visit was beyond their capabilities . maybe they do n't need more pupils coming to their school - i do know that resting on your laurels is never good . i expect the teachers at doha college are good but if their administration is as weak as it appears parents will take their children elsewhere for fear of bad management . first impressions still count !

how much can the extras go up to a sherborne ? are those usually covered by the company ? and how have you folks found the school so far ? it seems to offer a lot of extra-curricular activities and has a good backing . any other schools that you 'd recommend - my sons are 6 and 3.5 cheers

hi , i am a mother of a 6 yr old boy and is looking for a good school in doha . i recently got a call for an opening for my son at sherborne.i am confused as i have also heard about asd that its also a very good school . as yr child is in sherborne , can you please let me know how the school is ? should i opt for sherborne or wait for asd to reply ? how are the teachers at sherborne ? hows the atmosphere ? are u satisfied ? please let me know your feedback . i will really appreciate . thanks ,
sherborne qatar
sherborne qatar is a school run as a business making profit . it is owned by one of the al-thani mob . there are lots of problems with this school . many higly experienced teachers left after just one year and a another teacher recently quit . they have tried to set up a british prep school in the desert - it just does not work . few of the remaining staff have much international experience - most of them are snobby types from the uk with little overseas experience or knowledge about arab customs . the organisational of the school is poor - reactionary management . contact with the head is limited . they have a board of govenors made up of pompous types . there are very few decent schooling options in qatar and it looks like that sherborne qatar will never live up to the advertised promises . avoid for now - far too many problems related to cultural adjustment .
susan chang can you back your claims
susan chang , you make lots of claims but what is your proof ? do you have or did you have a child at sherborne ? my personal experience as a qualified teacher , who has supported many of the students at sherborne , has been very positive . in fact i was sceptical about how well a new school could do in its first year . i have been quite surprised by what they have achieved so far both academically and in terms of students ' holistic development .
to mr. joe90
my proof is that i am friends with several teachers and families currently at the school or who have recently left . i stand by all i have said . there are really no decent schools in qatar . it is absurd to think you can set up a british prep school in the middle of the desert . the whole operation is a business shum run for money - a profit making venture trading upon a famous name . there are a bunch of pompous uk govenors who have a lot of egg on their faces at the moment and are doing everything to avoid swallowing their pride . the only reason the majority of the teaching staff did not leave last year is because they were granted a 10 % lump cash sum payment to basically remain hush and avoid speaking out . what more would you like to know ? the only reason the school survived its first year was because of the teachers , not for any other reason . the same can be said for many if not all the schools in qatar .
sustaining a corrupt system
quite frankly any school in doha indirectly helps to sustain a corrupt system of government -LRB- a family dynasty -RRB- , that directly depends on the mass importation of hundreds of thousands of poor people from countries like nepal , bangladesh , india and pakistan . these people are totally exploited and treated like modern day slaves . they survive on about 800 qr a month . no school in doha can deny that they indirectly helps to sustain such a system . that is why i say that there are no good schools in doha . their moral foundations are corrupt . it has nothing to do about ivy league universities . decent people should get out of this sham of a country . sherborne uk has jumped into bed with a corrupt family and have had their fingers badly burnt . they now lack integrity and all that they propose they stand for back in the uk .
they seem ok
we moved from dubai too and my kids are going to the same school , they seem to be alright however i am not quite sure about how strong are they in their acadamics
sorry susan chang
but using your own logic , you and your husbands jobs -LRB- or you emotionally supporting your husbands decision to work here in qatar -RRB- are sustaining your employers , who in turn , are `` sustaining corrupt family monarchies who deny their citizens and visitors basic human rights and freedoms '' . therefore the only logical option open to you is to leave . this is the first time i have suggested that anyone should leave qatar - but unfortunately this is the corner you have painted yourself into .
susan chang
first of all , the only reason sherborne established a branch here because it 's part of the supreme council of education `` education for a new era '' outstanding schools initiative . which is a rand initiative -LRB- if you know what i mean -RRB- . so far , qatari students accounts for less than 10 % of the total number of students . most qataris enroll their offspring in government schools . overall , private schools target expatriates who works here , and the fact is most of the expatriates who enrolls their offspring in private schools receives education allowance from their employers and let 's be honest , most of you wishes deep inside that your countries are a monarchy . the immigrants are sucking your resources dry , degrading your national health & education systems . despite all that your salaries are deducted as taxes to pay for the welfare of those immigrants . and yet , you got to pay for utilities ; -RRB-
insightful paragraph
hello genesis , would you adopt a affirmative or negative viewpoint ? schools like sherborne have put into place racially discriminatory quota systems of not enrolling more than 20 % qatari students , not 10 % as you did suggest . of course sherborne can get away with this in qatar and would never be able to implement such an unfair policy back in the uk . your paragraph about immigrants sucking the national health and education system dry is sheer nonsense . a simple and poorly worded opinion without evidence or substance . as for adley , i am pleased that you have managed to reach some sort of conclusion . i really think that all highly trained western expats including yourelf should leave qatari , not just me ! more debate is required .
school demographics is an issue
school demographics is an issue in the uk just as much as it is in qatar . it is difficult to maintain a high standard of learning if a large proportion of students in a classroom are not fluent in the language of instruction . the way most private schools in the uk address this issue is by setting a limit on the percentage of non-native speakers of english . otherwise , the majority of the population in these schools would consist of indian and chinese students . this is because of the sheer volume of applicants from these two countries . in qatar those schools , with a small population of first language english speakers , such as qis and al-jazeera academy , tend not achieve the same standards as those with more first language speakers . this does not mean that those students who are not fluent in english are less able but it does show that not being fluent in a language can be a barrier to learning .
school review - doha academy -LRB- so typical of qatar 's schools -RRB-
academic integrity of school 2 effectiveness of administration 2 academic and disciplinary support provided 2 director 's involvement in academics 2 fair and equitable treatment by board and director 2 school has adequate educational materials on hand 5 attitude of local community towards foreigners 5 cost of living in relation to salary -LRB- 10 = most favorable -RRB- 3 satisfaction with housing 2 community offers a variety of activities 6 availability and quality of local health care 6 assistance with visas , shipping and air travel 1 extra curricular load is reasonable 5 comments : sheikha aisha owns and operates this substandard ` international ' school . do n't be fooled , it 's an international school in theory but an islamic school for delinquent al thani children . all the students that have been expelled or refuse entrance to another school know they can attend doha academy . mr. farouk , head of the secondary school , is abully who rules through intimidation . he has his minions who follow him around like hungry puppies hoping that he 'll throw a bone their way . anyone who dares to stand up to him is a target of his . he derives immense pleasure in humiliating and demoralizing students . how this man was ever appointed in a school boggles the mind . sheikha aisha , the owner/operator , is notorious for not honoring contracts . foolishly i thought that once a contract was agreed to and signed , it would be honored . not so . she has blatantly broken contracts because she decided she did n't want to pay airfare . the sheikha is a dishonest , disreputable woman who is only after two things , money and prestige . she 's getting plenty of cash from the parents but refuses to reinvest it in the school . working for sheikha aisha is a miserable experience . now that she has turned the day to day operations over to mr. ali as head of secondary girls and mr. farouk as head of secondary boys , the school will take a dramatic downward spiral . -LRB- as an aside , both mr. ali and mr. farouk have in the past been taken to the police for assaults on students . these assaults took place during normal school hours . members of staff intervened in order to stop the altercation from becoming a brawl . yet , they remain thanks to the sheikha . -RRB- unless you want to work for and be sponsored by a woman who has zero integrity , no qualms about breaking a contract and no ethics , run a million kilometers in the opposite direction . no one of any repute should ever consider working at this school .
wow susan . . those are pretty
wow susan . . those are pretty inside stuff you 're bringing out . i 've my child going to sherborn in reception and so far i 'm pleased with the teacher and school system . though this is my first year and i 've yet to explorer . but my child is happy . i guess what ever happens in the background as long as it does not direclty effect the teching quality . but assaulting the student is a serious crime if this is true .
sherborne
we are all looking for the same standard of education they we get at home , and if we are putting our children into a private school , then the standard should be even higher . not seeing this with sherborne , they are doing what all the other schools do and that 's drop the level because they have too many 2nd langugage students . sherborne , is being filled with too many children to soon just to but bums on seats , and running on it 's reputation from the uk . it has no western admin staff , a balance would nice . why is that private schools are running with 22 + in class , in england a private operates with 12 maybe 15 . the homework is shocking , no grammar , no comprehension , no maths , science , history , french , geography yet to had this term ... thinking about moving my child if things do not improve .

international driver 's license ... valid for how long ?
how long can i drive in qatar with my international driver 's permit before i 'm forced to change my australian license to a qatari one ? when i do change over to a qatar license do i actually lose my australian license ? i 'd prefer to keep it if possible ...
re : international driver 's license ... valid for how long ?
it will work for 15 days from the date of entering the country . i used my int . drivg license for 2 weeks and then i made a qatari one .
re : international driver 's license ... valid for how long ?
it is valid for 6 months from the date you enter the country it is written in qataris law
re : international driver 's license ... valid for how long ?
depends on the insurer , qatar insurance company said this in email to me <blockquote> thank you for your email ! with regards to your query below , a foreigner is valid to drive in doha with the following conditions : foreign driver with his country valid driving license allowed driving only for one week from entry date foreign driver with international valid driving license allowed driving for 6 months from entry date foreign driver with gcc driving license allowed driving for 3 months from entry date </blockquote> as an aussie your driving licence should be transferable to a qatar one with only the eyetest -LRB- temporary , then permanent once rp sorted -RRB- .
re : international driver 's license ... valid for how long ?
the above is for a private car most hire car companies -LRB- check with them -RRB- will only allow 7 days on your aussie license or two weeks on your internation . these periods are from date of entry into qatar . you wo n't lose your aussie licence , you just get a qatari one as well .

i was in similar situation
i was in similar situation and traveled to dubai twice. :-LRB- dubai airport is large , but its depends on the terminal . the one for flydubai is tiny and no boarding bridge like doha airport . btw , are u canadian ? canadian passport holders can not get on-arrival visa to enter uae since jan 2011 . still be able to get bahrain visa on arrival but cost 5bhd .
oops i meant between dubai

my thoughts exactly , but why would they offer that if it 's not feasible ? i 'm panicking i do n't want to spend my day in an airport .

interestingly true .
best response so far srishti . i agree the authorized dealer workshops are also nothing but rip-offs . i personally know of some top branded car dealership workshops who take the cars from the customers and send it to these shady garages to reduce their cost , then they stamp their seal and call it ` agency maintained ' , but they rip off the customer 20 times more than the roadside garages too . and i cant agree more about the 90 % roadside mechanics all over the industrial area . none can be trusted .

try mysore garage on street
try mysore garage on street 48 gate 18 here is their website www.mysoregarageqatar.com its still a new garage but a few of my buddies have gone there to have major repairs done -LRB- jeep wrangler engine rebuild - 1 year no problems so far . runs good , caddy srx transmission repair -RRB- and had them done in good time at a fraction of dealership price . we also just bring our cars in for the maintenance stuff too , it is a few extra streets but they have reasonable prices and the main thing is i know i can trust these guys . i had a breakdown once and they arranged the tow and shuttled me back home and everything , they really do care . you want to call this guy henry +974 55 85 6229 he 'll hook you up .
my experience .
i went to kuwari garage on street 18 . they didnt really get up from their lazy benches to check the car when i told them what problems i had or what changes i need . they just told me the price . their price is good but they didnt guide me . then i went to the newly established maysore garare in street 48 . the guys there have worked in the actual dealerships -LRB- toyota -RRB- and the owner is also an ex-dealership workshop guy . they actually drover my car , tested all gears , lifted the car and i had 5 men checking every small detail . then the told me what i really need and what i could do without . there was no extra charge for all this coz i told them i will do all my work with them . i had new spark plugs and a new fuel filter that i told them to replace and they did that for qr 110 . on top of all they all speak good english.i choose mysore over kuwari anytime .

ford shelby eleanor 1967 - qatar
hi guys , just wandering if anyone on ql knows about this car or where i can get the cars engine computer programmed . the one we have is the original eleanor with `` ford racing '' engine . the ford service shop in industrial area dont seem to know anything about this car . any help would be greatly appretiated : -RRB-

what a piece of art ...
samyauk , having a 2010 engine makes it easier than the sophisticated '67 twin-carb . your best bet is to contact mohammad bin sulayem -LRB- the middle east rally champion -RRB- in dubai . he has a performance shop where he upgrades and work only with super engine cars . i know him in person and his passion towards racing cars in general and ford in particular would probably entice him to find a way for solving your problem . -LRB- you might have to ship the car their or they have to come here with some of their electronic devices to calibrate the engine -RRB- . i envy your hubby . he has two treasures : this master piece and you for finding him a solution ;--RRB- good luck . here is his contact details : ben sulayem performance p.o.box : 22740 - dubai - u.a.e tel : +971 4 2621155 fax : 971 4 2621177 email : bspturbo@emirates.net.ae www.bspturbo.com

the only alternative would be that you 'd have to go to voom tuning in dubai at street 8b , al quoz , dubai , united arab emirates . tel : 00971 4 3411640 http://www.tuningflavour.com/home.php?go=contact_us

my friend had the same thing with his 1966 playmouth barracuda , failed the technical check for blue and black smoke he went to alkhraetiat there is a good shope for carburators there you might wan na try it , worked like a magic and passed the check . 67 shelby with 2010 engine might as well put a 7 disk cd changer in it . these cars come with crappy stereo system .

which is the best economic car i can buy for myself in qatar ? please comment ...
petrol is cheaper than
petrol is cheaper than water , you should be asking about a car that doesnt break down and is easy to fix because mechanics here are just terrible , ive seen potholes smarter than some mechanics in qatar
saed is right , here in qatar ,
saed is right , here in qatar , we have to look for availabality of mechanics and cost of spare parts , for that , cars of nissan or toyota are best choice
suzuki swift or corolla or

by telling economic you mean
by telling economic you mean everthing and not only petrol cost -LRB- spare parts , maintenence , resell value , insurance & registration fees -RRB- , all are available in toyota cars . this is the situation in qatar only toyota everywhere even i do n't like toyota & i am not using toyota & i will never buy toyota !

camel
camel . . only grass he will eat.my very good friend ssantro loves camels a lot . moreover camel will give you loving stares too sometimes not like a bumpy humpy car demanding to go to service after every 1000 miles or 2000 miles . camel you can bath with water and nobody will object and if you will give shower to car all your neighbours will try to kill you by complaining to the authorities . go for a camel .
lucy . . camel will be too high
lucy . . camel will be too high to ride on , better to buy a donkey . but the big problem is where he can find grass for him ? sure petrol here is cheaper than grass .

yo u ask me , i d say a nissan tiida , why ? well coz it has the best engine , lovely award winning 1.8 lt unit and also the most space than say a lousy corolla or nissan sunny or any other similar suzuki , and a great re sale value ... -LRB- avoid french or americans !! -RRB- ... plus hey the car is voted the best car many times over ... toyotas be it vios 's aygo 's or corollas and nissan sunnys and the suzuki lot are over rated ... final comment : - 2010 or 2009 nissan tiida 1.8 se with alloy rims might not be as cheap as the others but thts value for ur money right there and a good investment

ist get the copy of passports
ist get the copy of passports and photos for your parents . get a letter of your salary status from your employer -LRB- better in arabic -RRB- . then go to immigration department in madina khalifa . there are typesets who will provide and type forms of visa application . after just follow their instruction that where and how to submit . best of luck
you are a manager , right ?
so i suppose you have a `` not small '' company with a mandoob . if you have one , talk to him to get an accurate answer -LRB- and if there is anything to clear , he 's just there in your company -RRB- . or go to immigration office or visit their website -LRB- but i suggest you go directly -RRB- to ask for all the requirements

yes . it is one of the requirement of the labor / immigration .
re : free visa
how come free visa where u can find free visa in qatar are u sure ?
re : free visa
there is no free visa
re : free visa
there is no visa called ` free visa ' all employment visas are the same.usually the sponsors will not allow those who are under their sponsorship to work for other compnaies , but some sponsors do allow to work for others by taking some rewards from the employees and these are referred as free visas .
re : free visa
there is no free visa in qatar.you have to work with sponsor or with other sponsor with permission of govt or illegaly , that is not advisable .
re : free visa
what do you mean by `` free '' visa ?
re : free visa
well there is no visa called free visa all visas are employed visa , the difference is only that the sponsor do allow you to work upon your choice for that you have to obtain a noc letter from existing sponsor which should be endorsed by immigration dept. its a permit to work in another sposorship which is valid for six month and than later on you have choice to change sponsorship according to your choice but the new visa does not allow you to change sponsorship until you finishes the first year ... regards ... - naeem -

post it so we can see what it says , where is it from and other such important information . ca n't really comment on it without knowing any of the facts .
re : flu vacinations
i have not recieved a email to stat this but even if i had i would ignore it my kids never got a flu vaccine when we lived in uk so i wont be giving them one living here in doha but this is just my pereference
re : flu vacinations
the sec will issue consent forms for children to receive seasonal flu vaccinations . we understand that these forms will be issued on sunday 4 october , to be returned on monday 5 october . the intention is to begin vaccinations against seasonal flu as soon as possible . they confirmed that without the consent of parents they will not vaccinate children . h1n1 vaccine is not yet available more news from the sec on this will be forthcoming in due course . the sec have no plans to vaccinate adults in school at this stage .
re : flu vacinations
i am not a medical person , and would like to know the advantages and dissavantages of giving this to my child , also if the advantage outways the dissavantage , because i would feel quilty if something happens to my child due to my refusal to give her this vacination .
re : flu vacinations
please all remember this vaccination is only for seasonal flu and not the h1n1 strain . so think before signing do you really need it ? it will not protect your child from swine flu . .

marriage leave
dear all i would like to know that is there any rule in qatar labor law which states that a person can get a marriage paid leave for certain amount of time ? your answers and suggestion would be greatly appreciated .
re : marriage leave
it amazes me that a qatari asks such questions , thought they would no more than the rest of us . i suppose though marriage is a death , either to the husband -LRB- slow and lingering -RRB- or to the wife if she changes her name , the birth of a new woman -LRB- already mature -RRB- and the death of the old as the name no longer applies .
re : marriage leave
no man , there is no such leave in labor law , u gon na take it from ur annual leave balance .
re : marriage leave
not sure about qatari labour laws , but our companys gives 7 days for such leave .
re : marriage leave
depends on your company . . we get 10 days marriage paid leave : p

what to wear ??
i 'm moving to qutar on friday -LRB- in 2days . what can i wear ? what ca n't i wear ? can i wear knee length dresses and skirts ? can they be just above the knee ?
re : what to wear ??
you can wear whatver you want as long as it doesnt draw attention to yourself . clothes that cover you and dont show too much skin is ok . you can wear skirts or trousers or jeans or dresses . as long as there is not too much skin show anything is ok ... welcome to doha !
re : what to wear ??
yes i guess tinkerbell has kind of summed it up . skirts up to knee roll are ok i guess . . :-RRB- welcome to doha
re : what to wear ??
you have to remember that qatar is a conservative muslim country by law , but as with most places a lot of the rules are bent here . the one thing you have to remember which was states before you do not want to wear something that is to revealing so that people do not give you a hard time . for females you can wear whatever you want but then you have to deal with the after math of having inappropriate comments being made and in some cases harassment from both the people and the police . for men its is a lot easier but some times the same problems arise . so the best advice i can give is that you dress for the summer but nothing to revealing .
re : what to wear ??
you can wear everything in moderation , as qatar is a conservative country

how can i get a job in th oil industry when i have no experience in the field and minimal relative education ?
i 'm looking to obtain work out of canada or do business elsewhere , simply because i need a change . any ` short cuts ' any suggestions would be greatly appreciated .
re : how can i get a job in th oil industry when i have no ...
good question my friend . i started in the oil industry 20 years ago with no experiance or reletive qualifications . 20 yeras on i 'm now working for an oil company in qatar but to start with i started working for a service company . drop me an e-mail through qatar living and i will try and give you few pointers in the right direction
re : how can i get a job in th oil industry when i have no ...
short cuts might benefit you only for a short period . there is no short cut to success according to me . if you have luck by your side , you can do miracles , if you dont then you need to struggle the hard way . oil & gas industries dont have kids running the show , professional experience and solid education back ground is need in these sectors . good luck
re : how can i get a job in th oil industry when i have no ...
it is not necessary to have oil related experience or education to get a job in the oil industry . all kind of profesional is needed in the oil industry be it on it , engineering , legal , medical or even teacher .
re : how can i get a job in th oil industry when i have no ...
1 - find the names of as many oil companies and contractors as posible , prepare a good cv -LRB- resume -RRB- using the best of your knowledge focus in what ever you know how to do best -LRB- do n't lie -RRB- , give a title to your cv -LRB- for example : hr officer , secretary , tea boy what so ever -RRB- now apply online and personally against all positions available related to the field you know best . 2 - keep your phone with ya , you do n't want to missed a call !! while waiting for any interview appointments , go to get urself a good suit and polish your shoes lol -LRB- shave and cut ur hair -RRB- , you only get one chance to make a good impression and be lucky enough to have `` the golden opportunity to `` develope ur new career '' , be confident at all times . '' that should do it '' good luck !

red light cameras
hi , today i made a mistake of crossing an orange line at an intersection somewhere between city center and oryx roundabout . can someone please either tell me if there is any red light cameras there , or a list of red light cameras installed in qatar so that i can see if that one is listed or not ? thanks for your help .
re : red light cameras
go to moi traffic violation site , put your plate number then you will see if you got the violation or not .
re : red light cameras
i did , but i think it takes 2 days to appear . at least right now , there is no fine there .
re : red light cameras
be patient for best results
re : red light cameras
there are cameras at the tornado tower intersection and at the cbq tower intersection near the general post office . you get caught if you jumped a red light . good luck .
re : red light cameras
i eventually did n't receive a ticket , which means that if you mistakenly cross the lights while orange on your side of the intersection , and become red by the time you reach the other end of the intersection , you should be fine .

i 've got a really good deal from doha-detroit-doha for only 3200 qr . you can try http://www.kayak.com/ . and i aggree with ukeng , expedia.com will be good too . but , you need to have a credit card which is issued by canadian/us institution - that 's the drawback of expedia & cheaptickets . good luck
re : which airway offer the best fare from doha to houston ...
best fare or best flight ... i once had a cheap klm flight , through amsterdam -LRB- a 24hour flight -RRB- i prefer the direct qatar airways flight -LRB- preferably in business class -RRB- it 's a direct doh-iah 17h flight -LRB- 10am to 5:30 pm same day -RRB- the flight back is a 15h flight -LRB- 7:45 pm to 7:45 pm next day -RRB- ... timezone differences make the numbers seem illogical : -RRB-
re : which airway offer the best fare from doha to houston ...
like mentioned before , qatar airways is the best bet . a flight from doha to houston will be around 1400 usd depending on the time of year you go . for example , a flight near christmas time would be a couple hundred dollars more expensive . i 've searched taking a longer flight with layovers and it is always over a thousand more so it 's sooo not worth it .

water in public wash rooms
why public toilets in qatar are so dirty even you go to 5 star hotels or any good restaurants there toilets are spilled with water all over . is it necessary to have a water in toilets ? in western world there is no water in the public toilets and they are very clean . last week i went to shark village one of the top hotels in the country and was not able to use the toilet as it was all spilled with dirty water suggestions please
if so many people are so
if so many people are so disgusted by it , why does it persist ? why does everyone just accept that this is the way things are in qatar ? it just boggles my mind that management at all the major shopping centers fell no compulsion to offer clean and sanitary toilets to patrons , or that the municipality does n't enforce any cleanliness standards . i just do n't know how people can live like that .
this , unfortunatley is
this , unfortunatley is acceptable to some and some feckwit thinks that westerners are dirty by using bog roll ???!! perlease !
umm adam is so correct
go to disneyland where it is far more crowded than any place in qatar and you wo n't smell any stink from western people ! here in qatar it is such an ordeal to stand in queue in some public place or in huge crowd because of smelly stinky odor from certain folks who do not believe in washing their bodies and clothes before venturing in public again , have you ever seen filthier bathrooms than here : landmark , city center , waqif , hyatt , villagio , mcdonalds , burger king , ... . . everywhere !!!!! why is dubai so much better ? why mosques in dubai are 100x cleaner than doha ?????
i was staggered by the filth
i was staggered by the filth in the public toilets at souq waqif . i 'd rather piss against a wall than set foot in those toilets again . whoever is ` running ' souq waqif is useless . the place is an utter embarrassment for tourists in that regard . if you want anyone to have a meal and spend more than an hour there , they will need toilets ... and this is the number 1 place to take tourists in qatar ? i guess it 's a true reflection of the filthy attitude of many people in this country . no wonder western tourists hate the place .
all this talk of toiletary
all this talk of toiletary taboos might help explain the incredibly high rate of sterility amongst the local population . it ca n't be clean having so much urine and faeces swirling around on the floor , walls and misting into the air . perhaps that 's why the local men and women have so much trouble conceiving .

people who visit these public toilets are great artists i must say , one can see it on the door and walls of the toilets ... :-RRB- <a title="everything you need to know about living in doha, qatar" href="http://www.qatarliving.com"> <img src="http://static.qatarliving.com/badges/150x50_iloveqatarliving.gif" alt="everything you need to know about living in doha, qatar" /> </a>
water is everywhere
in the public toilets ... because the person using do not mind others and sometimes , irresponsible customers just leave their mess without even cleaning and flushing afterwards .
ohhhh , that says it all
ohhhh , that says it all then ... . .
hasan you have got to be
hasan you have got to be kidding me , what the hell are you on about only reason to why bathrooms stink here is not because of the people who use them , or the way that they use them , its because those shopping centers or hotels dont fork over the necessary money to keep them clean , no proper maintenance , cheaply build and no proper clean up staff ...
have you ever imagine there are still people
from a part of the world do their ` business ' in the bush or just along the roadside . . and here they are ... thousands died every year from cholera especially after flood . .
i must agree with dottie . .
the public toilets in qatar are revolting . if they are not swimming in diluted shit , there 's 300 men with there hands and feet in the sinks , spitting in every direction . yesterday i stood next to a man and his child in the toilets in city centre , whilst they cleansed themselves in the urinal . ffs , wheres the hygiene in that !!!
what about the badwis or nomads in the desert ...
where they do theirs . . ??
after travelling a bit in
after travelling a bit in india . . i find the toilets in doha much much much better . . lolz . .
water must . . paper no way . .
water must . . paper no way . . eeks
sorry no hard feelings !!!
recently i have visited doha from canada for two days . three things caught my attention right away 1 . water in public washroom , even at the airport . 2 . speed limit and driving style 3 . i saw one kid -LRB- 2-3 yrs old -RRB- , with no child seat and seat belt on which was pretty scary . i think it is nothing wrong with using water in a washroom , this is just some people do not have courtesy to leave it clean for the next person . qatar is one of the richest country -LRB- per capita income in 2007 was more than 80k i guess -RRB- on this planet , so it is fair to expect that everything should be nice and clean in this country . hopefully i did not hurt anybody 's feelings .

i 'm not saying that westerners stink ... but again i consider the use of toilet paper as an improper and inappropriate habit , this is dirty ! i prefer to see water spilled than a used piece of paper , or a roll that has been manipulated by dozens of fingers ... <a href="http://s464.photobucket.com/albums/rr6/dawestsidesscreaming/?action=view&current=291589im9sf5.gif" target="_blank"> <img src="http://i464.photobucket.com/albums/rr6/dawestsidesscreaming/291589im9sf5.gif" border="0" alt="photobucket"> </a>
solution
public toilets should have drains in the floors , and the floor should be built so the foul water flows into the drains rather than form puddles . i would equally complain if dirty bog-roll was left strewn all over the bathroom , so i think there 's no excuse for leaving excrement-laden spray covering the cubicle . however , the problem would be much less apparent if the water drained away properly .
toilets in doha are
toilets in doha are disgusting and a disgrace !!! when you arrive at doha airport and want to use the toilets -LRB- speaking of the ladies ' of course , ca n't comment on the gents ' -RRB- the first impression of doha is not good !!! only 2 toilet cubicles , both dirty and swimming in dirty water and overflowing bins . why oh why ca n't they build decent toilets in this country ?? the toilets in the new malls esp . villaggio are horrible !! cheaply constructed from formica - water and dirty paper everywhere . is it really so difficult ?? go to the malls/hotels / airport in dubai and you can see the difference . why ca n't it be the same here ?? i will do anything to avoid using public toilets here , which is sometimes very inconvenient , but i do n't want to bare my b * m to these hellholes !!
the worst
i think the worst i 've seen in any shopping mall are the gents loos in landmark . there 's dried shit stains up the walls and dead roaches in the light fittings . it baffles me how anyone feels happy shopping for food after using those toilets .
lol ... ... . . i wish that
lol ... ... . . i wish that were an option for me . lol
westerners continue with
westerners continue with your habit of using paper and not water ... this way we can save water ...

kfc toilet
opposite mega mart is always like wading through a partly drained swimming pool . i really do n't appreciate sloshing through the floating detritus and diluted feces of the previous user !!! <span style="font-style: italic"> `` deaths in the bible . god - 2,270,365 not including the victims of noah 's flood , sodom and gomorrah , or the many plagues , famines , fiery serpents , etc because no specific numbers were given . satan - 10 .

uk health department
in the 60 's the uk health department advised to use water hoses against toilet paper in the public schools in order to stop typhoid spreading among childrens , sorry i did n't find the link . and hasan is right to a certain extend , you ca n't clean that `` place '' toroughly only if using water , this is common sense . i will not say westerners are dirty people , but i look at this type of hygiene - paper - totally disgusting . and a body with no smell does n't automatically mean a clean body . use a whole roll if you want , this is nothing compared to a well guided water spray , lol ! <a href="http://s464.photobucket.com/albums/rr6/dawestsidesscreaming/?action=view&current=291589im9sf5.gif" target="_blank"> <img src="http://i464.photobucket.com/albums/rr6/dawestsidesscreaming/291589im9sf5.gif" border="0" alt="photobucket"> </a> hardcore gamer !

water , unlike in western
water , unlike in western world it is very essential in asian countries ... for your knowledge here people clean with water not with paper ... and the thing about water being spilled here and there that is as princess said just ignorance and bad cleaniness manners ...
alexa agreed with your
alexa agreed with your point ... western people are definately not dirty after using paper and remain dry after using toilets ... but atleast you should not point out or question like comikalee did ... it is the way of life here ... people feel clean after using water ...

will 8000qar per month enough ?
i work in the uk on a salary of 17,000 gbp after tax . i have a feeling my company will be offering me a comparable salary to work in qatar . this does not include any benefits , so i will have to pay for accomadation etc. i am a british citizen , 23 and single so i do not need anything too lavish . what do you fine citizens of ql think ?
not enough
no way near enough if you have to pay your own accomodation . check ql classifieds to get an idea of the going rate for apartments . everything here is more expensive , except for petrol . you need to be making a good deal more than you were in the uk .
are you sure its qr .8000 ? a
are you sure its qr .8000 ? a decent single bed apartment cost 4000 to 5000 . . whats left ? for a car you will have to pay 2000 per month . . so its too less ... <a href="http://s434.photobucket.com/albums/qq67/formattedsoul/?action=view&current=0003.gif" target="_blank"> <img src="http://i434.photobucket.com/albums/qq67/formattedsoul/0003.gif" border="0" alt="photobucket"> </a>
just to give you a brief
just to give you a brief idea about living costs in qatar , take a good look at these facts : 1 - rent of a 1 bedroom apartment in a mid-class area is from 3,500 up to 4,500 qar per month . sharing an apartment with someone else may save you around 1,000-1 ,500 qar per month . 2 - renting a small car -LRB- 1500 cc -RRB- is around 1,500-1 ,700 qar per month . 3 - food costs for a single per month are around 800-1 ,500 qar depending on what you eat and drink . the previous number increments if you drink alcohol . 4 - going out on weekends costs around 200-300 qar depending on what you do -LRB- that 's about 800-900 qar per month -RRB- . 5 - water and electricity bills are around 300 qar per month . any extra services like mobile and internet are at about 250 qar each -LRB- that 's another 500 qar per month -RRB- . need i continue ... ?! i do n't think so . ********************************* <b> <i> obstacles are what you see when you set your eyes off the goal .
u will not be having much

police report
what is the process for getting police report for accidents ?
re : police report
you should call the traffic police and inform them about the accident to enable them to see the accident -LRB- but dont block the road if it is a minor accident -RRB- or both of the vehicles should be taken to the nearest traffic departmen . in this case both parties should agree who is responsible for the accident .
re : police report
1 -RRB- call 999 if you are on the accident spot ! 2 -RRB- in case the accident is minor and fault is accepted by either one , then you both may directly go to the nearest police station and you will get the report instantly . if third party was not involved in the accident & you damaged the car by yourself , you can follow the same procedure # 2 above .
re : police report
you go to police station , bring your documents and get a police report . possible you need to take a number ? but that 's the procedure .
re : police report
this is what happened . . on the 26th of january this guy was in a reverse and he hit me . . he admitted his fault and told me whatever the damage he would pay . . i thought that police report is not needed because we both agreed but i was wrong . . do i still need the details of his land cruiser ? he gave me his number and he is such a nice guy he would stick by his word but the service center says they wont fix a thing without a police report ? i need the location and office timing please .
re : police report
i think you need to go to the police station located in the area of the accident . talk to the guy who hit your car , and agree on a time for meeting at the police station.i think both of you should be present at the station . explain the situation , you may need to pay a fee for paper work , and they may call you the following day for the report . take your id , id copy , istimara , and insurance documents with you . make sure that you clear any of your earlier radar fines , to get the report .
re : police report
call that guy -LRB- who hit your car -RRB- , and tell him that you will meet in the police traffic division - the nearest police traffic division were the accident took place , to whatever time you are both two comfortable of , since the traffic division is 24hrs , except i think there is no office during friday and saturday . . and if as you said the guy is the culprit then he should pay 100 plus 20qr for the report , and you as the victim will also pay 20qr for the report . . after that check with your arabic friend who can read and interpret the report -LRB- since the report is typed in arabic -RRB- , ask them what is the name of the insurer of the car who hit you , and google their contact nos , lastly go directly to their office -LRB- insurer -RRB- and give them the police report . . and the they will give you the details on what you will do next . . i hope that helps ...

they will stamp your passport
they will stamp your passport once your rp is revoked .
very normal
the stamp on ur passeport wo n't affect ur chances in recruitement elsewhere than in doha . if ur leaving doha to dubai , no problem at all if they stamp it . good luck .
now days anywhere in gcc
now days anywhere in gcc -LRB- including dubai -RRB- did not allow duel residency -LRB- work visa -RRB- so you must cancel your visa from here -LRB- qatar -RRB- , otherwise you have to stay in your home country morethan 6 months -LRB- automatically cancell your visa -RRB- you may stay 6months or more on visit visa in dubai .
you must get your qatari rp

the emir to come and sign ?
i doubt the emir has anything to do with cancelling of visas , unless you are working directly for him ... he has plenty of lacky 's doing his leg work .
i am sorry , its mudhir not

re : ms in psychology
i really would n't advise studying msc in psychology online , sorry - you will not be taken seriously in the work context with an online psychology degree , especially at masters level ... unless of course you will not be looking to work as a psychologist anyway
re : ms in psychology
i didnt took online degree . the university i studied also providing distance education.and for distance education we have to attent classes on centers , and there will be workshop also.i already completed my msc psychology , only after that i took didtance education in ms psychology .

best spot for catching crabs ?
does anyone know of any good locations to go crabbing ? the only place i know where people go crab hunting is at simaisma -LRB- crabs not as abundant as before -RRB- .
re : best spot for catching crabs ?
you could probably catch crabs in the watering hole in the sheraton .
re : best spot for catching crabs ?
my friends catches crabs at wakra sealine area . however , i 've seen their catches , it 's small crabs but good in volume .
re : best spot for catching crabs ?
go to fish market near salwa road

is it okay to ride mini bike in qatar ?
i have one minibike 49cc . . can i ride in qatar ?

drive safe your family is waiting for you .

i 'd guess as with most countries you can drive them on private land -LRB- with the owner 's permission -RRB- . if you want to use it along salwa road and have a death wish - feel free ! at the end of the day , we all see people on quad bikes with inadequate lights and no protection on the roads here at times , so why not a mini bike ? whether you get away with it will depend on your nationality ! i trust you take out life and third party insurance before you start ! mini bikes on public roads in the uk set a bad example for the `` real '' motorcyclists so it wo n't be any different here . your call ...

super fuel in place of premium
i am putting super fuel in my car -LRB- civic 2004 -RRB- in place of premium . what effect it will have on it ? any improvement in pick up , mileage , performance ?
re : super fuel in place of premium
i believe it would dammage your lamda sensor
re : super fuel in place of premium
look in you car 's user manual . it will tell you there what -LRB- minimum -RRB- octane to put in it .
re : super fuel in place of premium
hi nothing will happen my friend believe me it happened to me so many times but now my friend keep it till the red light mark in ur car then return back to premium good luck
re : super fuel in place of premium
it will increase the life of engine
re : super fuel in place of premium
a higher octane rating does not have any effect on cars with a normal compression rating . high performance cars got usually a higher compression rating and therefore have to withstand knocking -LRB- detonation -RRB-
re : super fuel in place of premium
just use 95 or 97 octane ... others will harm the engine ... also check your manufacturer 's manual ...

my room mate is going , now i think will i get the new room mate same like him , he was a good human being offcource .
when choosing someone
make sure you find someone that has the same ideas as you . i would suggest going out and relaxing over dinner and chatting . my housemate and i get on well . i found her through a friend of mine . she is the same nationality as me . she works for qatar airways in a management position , so she travels alot ... which is a bonus as we both get our space . you must have the same or similar out look to life ... or you will be butting heads constantly .
room mates you could do without
besides sharing lungis , trying to act busy and unavailable when cleaning and tidying up has to be done in the room but right on time when free food or sweets are to be shared , excuses and regular delays when his part of the rent is due , has bad stories and gossip about others but never himself and the list just goes on and on ...

do you shop online with auctions ?
i am setting up my home and am thinking of trying ebay or similar sites to try to save money . i might try to list some of my things to sell as well . i am wondering about shipping and fees and so on . does anyone have experience with this ?
timebandit , i wish i owned
timebandit , i wish i owned the site , but i do not . i was hoping to find something like it to use to make purchases .
ebay
ebay is good . . two things . mind where you are buying the stuff from . if you are buying from china or hongkong , then the seller would ship the item to qatar with hk post which is cheap and most of the times he offers it free , but the wait time is minimum one month and 45 days is normal . you can opt to get it by hk registered post too with additional shipping cost ranging from $ 4 to $ 20 , which is much faster and secure . if you are buying from other countries like us , the standard shipping is done with usps which is no better than hk post , its take a month too , alternatively if you opt to get it shipped with ups/dhl/fedex from the buyer , then price for shipping ranges anywhere from $ 140 . alternatively to buy from the us seller is easyshop by dhl , or shop n ship by aramex . check their website to know how they work .
thanks , shyams . i am
thanks , shyams . i am thinking of trying the one i listed above just to see how it works . i think it is in qatar , so the shipping may be better . i think i will try to sell something first , because the site looks so new - there are n't too many things to buy . i 'll let you know how it goes .
no problem
you are welcome . . till now i havent seen any ebay seller from qatar ...
mojo , how did the buyers
mojo , how did the buyers back out ? that kind of stinks . so did they or did n't they get sold in the end ? i want to list something and i suppose it 's free so i would n't lose anything ...
backed out in a sense ...
backed out in a sense that ... they had not read the specs well , though i had them listed , their issue was with the processor of my laptop and also under the assumption that it was with a video card . . which it was n't . but for me to list it there again , is because i believe it will work . . if not now then some other time . mojo1981
i signed up , but have n't
i signed up , but have n't listed anything yet .
let us know how it goes ,
let us know how it goes , will you ?
well to be honest
well to be honest geekgirl ... i just want my items to be sold . . and will try various avenues till it gets sold . . and being free is an added bonus . the thing i feel while being in qatar is that unlike back home in australia or anywhere else a lot of people know what auctions are ... its yet catch up here !! mojo1981
excatly
the real meaning of auction is to catch up here ... the reason 1 . the country is small , you can always call up the seller directly and negotiate the price . 2 . can always drop in to check the stuff yourself . 3 . the price . 4 . options
i agree shyams ...
i agree shayams . . for me to give an update , i had used the qlassified.com as an avenue to advertise and sell the items . what has happened so far is that a resident in a-khor community bought my hp laptop for a price that was favourable to me ... but in the end i sold . as mentioned earlier my end goal would be to sell my unwanted items through any means ... the site i would is doing is job as intended . i do hope more people would start putting up their stuff as well ... as the concept is good while its in qatar . again thats too much text before i head off to ras laffan . mojo1981
it would be good ,
it would be good , especially , for people who prefer to not meet in person . i get nervous setting up a meeting with someone i do not know . an auction site might be a good idea as a `` middle man '' .
great shopping on ebay . . i
great shopping on ebay . . i had done several times ... shipping cost should be mention on item description , if not just ask the seller ... but be careful on reading the fulll description carefuly , regarding like warranty , refund , exchange , damage , geniune , new or used etc. . .
online shoping and shipping
i think thats hectic for a place like qatar . especially the shipping costs and the time taken to arrive . why dont you try any local shops like home centre or homes r us if its for furnitures ? there are a hundred other shops in salwa road for furnitures , household items etc etc etc. wats that u exactly wan na buy ? -LSB- img_assist | nid = 17892 | title = http://braveatheart.blogspot.com/ | desc = | link = none | align = left | width = 180 | height = 135
i use ebay in conjunction
i use ebay in conjunction with aramex for shipping . some sellers on ebay will ship direct to qatar as well . you will need to decide if it 's wiser to spend the extra on shipping or perhaps buy locally . aramex are a cost effective shipper from the states and the uk . when you join their shop & ship service they give you a postal address in the usa and uk . you have you items delivered to that address , and then they forward your goods to a depot here at reasonable rates . i do n't think selling items on ebay is a viable option from qatar . but somebody else may think otherwise . <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081633/" title="i love photography"> <img src="http://www.blodyn.net/images/photographer.gif" width="65" height="64" alt="i love photography" /> </a>

special k kellogs ... . . is it useful ?
dear all , i wud like to knw how many of u have tried the special k kelloggs challenge . . ?? was it effective?im skipping 1 meal as per their program to lose sme kgs and instead eating it ... has it worked for u ?? thanx for sharing ur genuine experiences ...
re : special k kellogs ... . . is it useful ?
if you have a special k meal you will lose weight because you will have a lower calorie intake . should work .
re : special k kellogs ... . . is it useful ?
and to check calories in your food , go for -LRB- www.nutritiondata.com -RRB-
re : special k kellogs ... . . is it useful ?
it can work but the danger is to re-gain the weight once you go back to your normal diet . if you just want to loose a few kilos to get inside a dress why not -LRB- but our bodies do not like very much this kind of games :--RRB- . for a healthier diet , change your way of eating by taking out the extra -LRB- extra quantity , extra sugar and fat -RRB- and add the good ones -LRB- fruits , vegetables and exercise -RRB- . you may not loose weight as quickly but it will last . check your bmi kg/m2 -LRB- body mass index -RRB- , decide what bmi you want to reach -LRB- to be healthier and/or to fell better -RRB- and allow you some time to reach it . http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/body_mass_index and whatever you do -LRB- diet , exercise -RRB- , you have to enjoy it , if not one day or another you will swap to your old habits : - -RRB-
re : special k kellogs ... . . is it useful ?
do n't replace your meal with special k. it is high in sugar and is made from simple white flour . if you insist on eating cereal instead of a normal meal then try eating one that reduces its sugars slowly . i.e. less refined and more complex carbohydrate . dorset muesli for example with nuts and unprocesses grains . with the simple carbs in special k you will just get an insulin spike and feel hungry soon after . generally if you want to lose weight then reduce your carbohydrate and increase green vegetables . so less potatoes , rice , pasta and as much green vegetation as you can manage .

how to get a bachelors degree ???
hi its really nice that you want to complete your bachelors degree , i have done my distance bba from sikkim manipal university , and it is also accredited by government . smude uses the latest edunxt technology to create a virtual classroom where you can interact with the faculty and students and thereby also network with other students , which is a unique and one of its kind feature amongst other colleges offering distance education . for the prospectus and speaking to their counsellor you can register for free http://www.smude.edu.in
online education
i think this thread is good enough for me to get info about the degree . i couldnt complete my degree because of my family reasons and now i want to do it as i am not getting any job for me . i did only part time jobs since , its been 5 years now , so would you get me some usefull info about this , i cant go to my country now and do it , any affiliated and accapetable university u may know for bach in computer science information technology . and second is long distance education acceptable here as real bach . thnks i will appreciate

re : best sunglass store in qatar
yateem sunglases store is the best . i am not his relative or hisa patner or working with him , or his suplier . i am only his customer snce long time especially for sunglasses . once i was attracted by one store making buy one get one . i had a very big hard experience with the way that salesmen behavior . they do n't want you to concentrate to purchase or get your free one as you like . i strongly suggest yateem or qatar optics are good . and maybe there are so many good stores i di n't mentioned i apologize . and for the store i had not been satisfied i tell soon or lator you will discover that you need to change sales managers and some sales men for their bad performance .
re : best sunglass store in qatar
you can find several sunglasses shops at city centre . solaris , next to giordano is newly opened . you can also try qatar optics .

many clinics : but which one is good and provides a reliable professional service at sensible prices ?
re : please recommend a dental clinic in doha
doha dental complex . montazah st. right after its junction with c-ring road go to the service road it will be on your right . dr. abdelnafe3 elsibaei ; one of the very few competent and honest dentists here who will not add extra fake work just for money .
re : please recommend a dental clinic in doha
by the way , i 'm not promoting a fellow egyptian doctor or so -LRB- he 's not egyptian -RRB- on the contrary , this queen clinic are mostly egyptians ; they are still competent but tending to overwork everything just for money that is not necessarily for your brnefit .

al-ahmadani dental clinic is very good , doctors there are great and helpful the prices are good . its in the ali bn jabor and sons building , and if u cant afford the price they make great discounts.they r really very nice people
re : please recommend a dental clinic in doha
best clinic is queen clinic , there is a branch in villagio . the back entrance of villagio , it 's obvious . and there is a branch in city center , at the parking lot . -LRB- ask about it there -RRB- . about the prices i do n't really know if it 's considered expensive or reasonable . my parents are regular clients there , and it 's excelllent ; with a very well experienced and professional team . the owner of the clinic is doctor mamdouh fareed . he is the best of all doctors there . go check it out anyways . good luck !

can unmarried girls work in qatar ?
hi . . i have come to qatar in visit visa.and i like to work in qatar.but i heard that girls with visit visa cant seek jobs here.i would like to know is it possible for me to work here under these limitations . . if no , can u suggest any alternative ?
re : can unmarried girls work in qatar ?
indeed they can
re : can unmarried girls work in qatar ?
yes , you can and they can ... qatar does n't ban single women from working . the issue would be not with your gender but with your visa . since you 're on the visit visa you need to find job/company that will provide with the residence permit before your current visa expires or else a fine of 200qr/day for overstaying . good luck !
re : can unmarried girls work in qatar ?
yes u can ,
re : can unmarried girls work in qatar ?
surely ummarried girls can work but the fact is that since ur visa is visit visa u have 2 first chng ur visa status 2 a firm then only u cn work becaus emost of the firms prefer females with family sponsorship ie husband/father status .
hamous and kubus for children
my daughter loves to eat hamous and kubus -LRB- arabic bread -RRB- can any body tell me whether it is good for her health thanks .
good enough
it is good for growing children but depends how and when it is consumed ... recomendations a -RRB- early b/fast b -RRB- early dinners better to consume with more olive oil -LRB- organic/extra virgin , first cold press -RRB- as a topping add on . two/three times a week is ok if your staple food is not lentil based . i assume you will be buying it from famous hamous guys -LRB- beruit -RRB- , order it without oil and use your own olive oil as recomended above . hope this helps
good enough
please read the second posting
i would say its marginally
i would say its marginally better for her health than kfc and krispy kreme doughnuts !

eid al-adha days off ?
it 's my first year in doha and i 'm not sure what days we get off for eid al-adha . can anybody tell me which days this year , private sector workers , get off for eid ? i want to get away for the long weekend but i ca n't book flights until i know for certain . thanks ,
re : eid al-adha days off ?
you may wish to fly out on 25th oct thurs. and return on 3rd nov sat . at max .
re : eid al-adha days off ?
that ca n't be right . i thought private sector workers only got three working days off .
re : eid al-adha days off ?
u can fly out 23rd night becoz 24 will be arafat it should be off.u have to be ready for work on 4 th of november . -LRB- government employees -RRB- private sector wil get only three working days off.i guess
re : eid al-adha days off ?
what is arafat ? to be clear . it 's my first year here and i work in the public sector . i need to know what days i get off . i have heard it is three working days . please can somebody confirm the dates .
re : eid al-adha days off ?
some people wo n't get any days off -LRB- workers in shops , domestic workers , taxi drivers etc -RRB- . some people will get 1 or 2 days off . some people will get 10 days off . it just depends who you are and whether your manager likes you . there is no hard and fast rule about who will definitely get a certain number of days off .
re : eid al-adha days off ?
i agree that is the case in reality . however , qatari labour law -LRB- law 14 -RRB- does make specific provision for eid al-adha holidays . for private sectors workings it states that you should get 3 working days off . if your manager insists on you working those days , then you are entitled to 150 % of your salary for those days . i do n't want to resight labour law , as these laws are not always adhered to . i just want to know which 3 days this will be this year if your manager just so happens to be a really nice guy and gives you the days off as per the 3 day requirement .

hhhaaa ... buddy , do n't u remember our schooling days ??? we all were somewhat same like ur kids . . not wanted to wake up early after spending long vacation ... or always used to give lame excuses to the parents ... wow , what a wonderful those days were ?? just be calm friend . . they r kids after all . . they will adjust soon . . try to make them understand with ur love and not by yelling on them . . it may give opposite result . . it does happen with we adults as well coz of the wintery feel in doha from december to february-march . . we too feel lazy to wake up for our office sometimes ... so be chill ...
soniya , you did n't
soniya , you did n't understand my post . i did n't take the vacation as i took just a couple of months before in summer . its not due to long vacations but due to falling temperatures kids are reluctant to wake up . hence i feel vacations should not be disturbed to facilitate parents or teachers . do you justify taking vacations in advance ?

blablabla , i had written that coz of this utter cold temperature kids r bit reluctant to wake up . . kindly read my post again . . its not even with the children but it happens to adults as well . . we feel bit lethargic during winter . . so its natural , the kids will feel same . . my daughter is still small to go for school . . but i can understand ur problem . . noone can force schools to go as per one 's own wish . . school authorities r fully responsible towards their children . . so evenif i want to justify my stand on vacation , its not gon na to sort out the problem . .
blablabla do they get 8 hours of sleep ?
blablabla do they get 8 hours of sleep at night ?
best-qatar said it ... . that is the truth ...
and there is no logic in blablablas argument . you make the kids sleep at 9 or 10 . and if they get up at 5 , they get 7-8 hours sleep , which is not bad . is it the kids find it difficult to get up or the parents who get up early to make kids ready ? ... lol

i am talking to a headhunter
i am talking to a headhunter and he was being coy . besides how much can you trust these people ? i did n't want to waste my time if i do n't get enough uplift to make a move worthwhile . like most expats , i will be coming to qatar to save more money than i can back home . i am getting 80k here in the uk , with 15 % bonus and a long term tie-in that adds another 15 % to 25 % depending on how the company share price does . of course taxes in the uk are very high , as is cost of living . but i understand cost of living in qatar is even higher -LRB- ? -RRB- .
rasgas salaries
yes it is $ 10k / month . first of all salaries are tax free here . also things are cheaper as compared to uk . rasgas providing excellent furnished villas to expats . children education is also by the company and graduate / bonuses and leave salaries are also there . overall best place to work in qatar is ras gas / qatar gas .
great . thanks sam .

re : quran question
for all those people who started to bash baldrick . . our prophet `` mohamed '' pbuh said to omar ibn el khatab ... `` do not be rude or stony-hearted or they will go far away from you '' if you want to discuss islam with someone you should be nice . . this is what our real islam told us how to deal with people . . or else he/she/they will take a bad impression about muslims and islam . . to baldrick it was clearly mentioned in our religion that whenever there is a prayer we should leave our life all of it behind and rush for it as the prayer is considered to be a call from god . . as if god is inviting you to his home . . so every real muslim will go . . i 'm sorry for what happened to u . . but the islam does n't mean any offense to those who r not muslim . . it expect them to understand our religion and just make little adjust to ur life wherever u go ... when we go to another country we follow their rules . . not ours . . right ?? so know the rules & regulations within the country u live in and try to cope with it . . hope i make it clear without any offense to anybody . .

kabayan -- educational certificate attestation
mga kabayan help please ... currently i am in dubai uae and i got new employer in qatar . . according to them they are in need of my attested education certificate ... how to do this and exactly what kind of attestation it is ? redribbon from dfa or ched attestation ?
attestation
<p> its easy just bring your papers to the phil embassy including the paper from ched . </p> <p> lagyan lang nila ng stamp . you have to pay them per page . </p>
same here , my educ cert was
<p> same here , my educ cert was really required for the processing of the work visa . got my cert attested by the phil embassy and after by mofa here in doha . but the p.e. can only accept it for attestation if its has red ribbon from dfa and the dfa authentication requires educational cert to be attested by ched . long process but it 's a must requirements . ;d might it help to ask your company again whether its ok to do the attestation in phil embasssy and mofa in dubai ? or as what mentioned above , try to inquire p.e. in dubai . if so , would they need the orig copy ? because it 's kinda a risky to send it via courier unless you personally hand it over to your company . . ? hope this helps . </p>
be careful . . do not ever
<p> be careful . . do not ever surrender the original red ribboned education certificate stamped by phil embassy & mofa - qatar ... you are required to submit a copy only ... make sure you have also copied the stamps from phil embassy & mofa-qatar ... the labor dept of qatar does not require the original ... you will only have to show them the original but they will not take it from you ... keep the original with you ... the red ribboned educ certificate has no expiration contrary to what other filipinos say ... remember it 's not that easy to get authenticated documents ... moreover , you will also need authenticated nbi clearance -LRB- red ribboned & stamped by phil embassy & mofa-qatar -RRB- . . this time you can surrender the original as the nbi clearance itself is valid only for 1 year ... </p>

does any one know about living in riadh ??
hi everyone my husband and i have been enjoing living in doha for 6 years . now we have a better job offer in riadh . we are a moslem egyptian family , so no problem with the religious atmosphere . but i am worried about how would life be comparing to open doha , especially for women . sports for kids ??? places to dine in with the family ??? parks ??? weather conditions ??? i need help . thanks
hazems mom
i was in saudi before . everything is there in saudi about what you are looking for . life is little difficult for bachelor over there . you can go for shoping alone by taxi . you can ride in a taxi . you can go alone by taxi but you must seat back side not beside the driver . if you wan na take any man with you then he must be your hubby/son/father / brother -LRB- not cousin -RRB- . always you have to wear abhaya covering your head . covering face is not mmendatory but ladies covering . as you are muslim , you will feel comfortable wherever you will go . hotel , restaurant , bank every places there is seperate ladies section available . weather is little dry then doha . in weekend you can go to makkah for umrah .
i am still there ...
i am currently working in riyadh and going to move to doha soon . i am also egyptian with my family . the life style here is different ... but do n't worry , it will be better if you live in a compound . at least in riyadh you can visit mekkah and madinah as much as you like . plus you have access to all gcc as in qatar . i agree with all the above positive things about riyadh . there is nice club located in the deplomatic quarter with good facilities , it is far a little bit but still ok . few negative things but depends on how you can manage it : 1 . no enough schools in riyadh with qualified staff . 2 . traffic is nightmare .
thanks britexpat
you gave me a alittle light at the end of the tunnel ! thamks
i lived in riyadh until just
i lived in riyadh until just recently and i am a western women - you can walk alone , you do n't need your husband with u to go shopping - maybe years ago but not now . there are plenty of muslim women out without their husbands . you don ; t have to cover your head - unless u already do . just make sure u carry a scarf as sometimes as women we do get asked to cover up - you will have to wear an abaya though . if u do go out with a man - he must be a relative . you do n't have to eat behind curtains in restaurants - that is your choice - but u must eat in the family section . i loved riyadh and i wld go back tomorrow . shopping is fabulous compared to doha - 90 % off sales - amazing , and sooo much variety compared to here . eating out is so cheap also and loads of variety to choose from . hope this helps .

is doha a good place for toddlers ?
hi , we are thinking about leaving our uk home to live in doha . we have a little boy who will be two in january and we are wondering if it is a good place for toddlers . are there any groups and play areas etc. also what kind of accomodation should we consider ? what are the benefits of living in an apartment block to living in a villa or compound . any information would be greatly appreciated . many thanks !
re : is doha a good place for toddlers ?
hi alison i advice to you to have a villa in any compaund because your baby will found more kids to play with them and spesialy there he will found a new frinds . thanks and regards
re : is doha a good place for toddlers ?
doha has plenty of play groups . live in a villa , more kids to play with .
re : is doha a good place for toddlers ?
yeah ! agree with ukengqatar . doha has plenty of play groups ... they are called `` majlis ''
re : is doha a good place for toddlers ?
well , as of our experience , doha is the worst place for todds and kids . first of all , there are n't many playgrounds only couple but they are always so crowded and the kids are so agressive you do n't even want your kid to go near them , the kids here have no respect and no manner , beside it gets super hot in summer so even forget about the parks . for sure its better to live in a villa . i would not recommend living here unless you make some good money to save for your future .
re : is doha a good place for toddlers ?
thanks guys . also , any particular area / compound we should live in ?
re : is doha a good place for toddlers ?
hi alison , i have recently moved to doha from the uk with a toddler in tow too . my son is going to be 2 in december so theyre roughly the same age . there are plenty of mother & toddler groups and nurseries to choose from . eventually , youll make friends with little people and be able to socialise with them more often so the children can play together . speaking from my own experience , my son is extremely happy here . he loves the good weather and he enjoys going swimming everyday too . the heat isnt really an issue , i think the air con is worse to be honest , i 'm always cold indoors ! i keep my son out of the midday sun and weve been ok so far -LRB- touch wood -RRB- . my hubby is home by 4pm ish everyday , so quality of family life is much better here than the uk . my hubby and son enjoy spending time together here , which wasnt so easily done in the uk . im currently living in an apartment , because hubbys company has paid for it for 3 months , but were looking for a villa to move into . i agree with the others , a villa in a compound is probably the better option . anyway , best of luck whatever you decide , feel free to ask any questions .
overstaying in qatar
hi , any advice for my friend who just confess to me that he is not currently employed to the company that promised him to process his working visa but after 11 months now still no action from the company . can you guys give us some ideas on what steps we should take . cause i am thinking of seeking a legal action from the labor department or going to a attorney or any other relevant offices to this case . thank you ,
re : overstaying in qatar
my advice is first try to convince the employer to process your visa as soon as possible . late sallary does not matter . also inform the employer that you are illegal resident now and will be problem if any emergeny exit required . also inform the employer with very soft words that if action not taken then you will be left with no option but to consult labor department .

traveling from doha to india , pakistan , bangladesh etc.-free checked in baggage
is it true that all airlines operating from doha to various asian destinations allow 40 kg of free checked in baggage ? can someone advise . regards

iphone , n97 or blackberry ?
which 1 wud u choose ?
if u want for style and
if u want for style and looks go for iphone ... . nothing comes near ... but there are few options missing in iphone , which other phones have normally ... dev , everything desirable , is either expensive , banned , illogical or seeing -LRB- married to -RRB- someone else ... . ; - -RRB-
bb the best
blackberry is the best for playing bricks . any challenger for my high scores ?
n97 is the best
n97 is the best mobile in my opinion
i have 3 of them .
i have 3 of them even the htc touch . nokia n 97 problem with stuck . black barry bold with screen problem i like iphone more then other , coz of games and can be use for internt browsing and even for using as mp3 . do n't make me angry !

i will go for n97 . . all the above 3 are good phones but iphone and blackberry are usless in qatar ... iphone still not launched officialy cant get the 3g settings to work . blackberry avilable through qtel but expensive ... . most of them u see are unlocked ones which is only good to show off and cant be put to good use . aana free , jaana free , pakde gaye tho khana free .
i have tried them
i have tried them all ... blackberry is the best . . lots of services and features ... however , its kind of a business fon more than any other
iphone/n97/bb
iphone/n97/bb from the above n97 stands out because of its 5mp camera and hd video recording . from the above phones anybody can send emails and access the internet unless one wants to use the company . net.qa email from qtel which bb has . but i think samsung omnia is the best out there as its gps with garmin software stands ahead . it also has 5mp camera combined with advantage of windows . check it out here : http://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_i900_omnia-2422.php

two routers
i have qtel and dlink router in 1 computer , but my dlink is not secured , is there anyone knows how to configure my dlink ?
config
if possible plz fix a appointment at ur convenient time and call me . i will config that . .
config
just connect your d-link router using a straight cable from one of its lan port to your pc/laptop . just type 192.168.1.1 in ur address bar , asks for username/password . default may be admin/admin . plz check .
thanks , but how to connect
thanks , but how to connect the dlink router in laptop ? i tried before to use cable wire i connect it to laptop and to the router of dlink but still i can not log into this ip add .
issue
hope you have to configure your lan adapter ip address . . can u just tell your d-link router model .
my dlink model is d-link
my dlink model is d-link airplus xtreme g dwl-2100ap wireless access point .
ip address
plz set ur pc ip to dhcp.ping 192.168.0.1 ... if u get reply then hit 192.168.0.1 in address bar . . username - admin,password-admin / none
do i need still to connect
do i need still to connect the cable wire in the router or no need ? can i do it direct here in my pc without using cable wire ? or i will do what you said from the start ? thanks ...
config
if u need to configure you have to connect with straight cable to pc/lap . else if d-link is connected with your network type 192.168.0.1 in address bar.else the 1 st one is the only way to do ...
i am connected both but this
i am connected both but this qtel is located on the ground floor so the signal is not good enough . we put extra router on the second floor .
it means you are connecting
it means you are connecting to qtel router using wi-fi and not lan cable . am i correct ? to setup dlink wap , you have to connect your laptop to dlink wap using a lan cable as azarajez said . but you have to check you router ip addy first , because usually wap are automatically obtaining ip addy from router -LRB- default -RRB- so , the ip addy of dlink wap changes .
d-link
so here it is . . ur using dlink usb dwa 125 rite.this is not a router , an wireless adapter to be used within lap/desk to connect to wireless networks . the thing u have to use is wifi repeater/bridge to extend wireless signals from ground floor to 1st floor . . hope you got the answer ...
i am connected using the
i am connected using the dlink adapter
security
the thing you have to do to secure your wi-fi is to connect to q-tel router ans set password maybe wep/wpa/wpa2 . hope wpa2 is more secure . .

@rizvi3150
have you asked the one who assessed you about your driving skills and where have you failed ? because by asking , you might improve and eradicate those mistakes the next time you would go for a license . when driving always see to it that your eyes are looking on the road and must not look on the shifting gear when you change shift . because a split second can endanger someone 's life or your life . slow moving vehicles must always use the right lane . when going for an intersection maybe let other cars pass before you continue . i forgot the right of way on whether you should go or stop . i think it 's better for the latter so that you can have a safe trip . also maintain a considerable distance if there 's a car in front of you . the distance would be the same as if you would imagine that there 's an equal size car in between the two of you . just in case the front car would go and hit his breaks , you would have the ability not to hit the front car with the distance you just imposed . hope you would pass next time and kindly tell the one sitting beside you on your next test to tell your mistakes after the result has been given .

re : can i drive to egypt without having triptec from ...
i read this thread while researching the triptic requirements for my drive from doha to london . now that i am back in london i think i can dispel some of the myths . i drove from doha through saudi , jordan , syria , turkey , greece , italy , germany and holland before taking a ferry to the uk . the car had a qatari number plate . saudi first , you do not need a triptic , just a visa -LRB- transit in my case -RRB- which is usually valid for 3 days . there is nowhere to buy a triptic anywhere near the jordan border . jordan , there is no need for a triptic or advance visa . this can be bought at the border along with car insurance . syria , there is no need for a triptic . i had a visa from the syrian embassy in doha . insurance can be bought at the border . turkey , there is no need for a triptic . visa can be bought at the border along with car insurance . greece , no triptic requirement , insurance can be bought at the border and covers the whole eu for one month . having entered the eu , there are no further visa , insurance or triptic requirements . egypt has a triptic requirement but is a nightmare to drive in . i would recommend leaving the car in aqaba and taking the ferry to nuweiba , where coaches operate to cairo .

re : can i drive to egypt without having triptec from ...
you must have a tripticket , which is required by the egyptian law . you also must have a passing visa through saudi arabia . and great amount of coffee to alert you while driving ; and great patient on the borders . have a safe trip
re : can i drive to egypt without having triptec from ...
thanks whatever-7 and mohammed 1000 but can i get this tripticket from the borders in egypt or it is a must to get from qatar ??? if it was from egyption borders then what is requisted for it ????
re : can i drive to egypt without having triptec from ...
hi , look if you want to go to egypt by car you need to do triptek from here since your car has a qatari plate number . i went to lebanon twice , first i went without a triptek but it was a lot of headache especially at syria borders , since i needed to pay twice on the borders . one when i entered and pass to lebanon and another time when i left lebanon coming back to qatar through syria borders . i advise you to do a triptek but you need a qatari guy to sponsor you ... enjoy your trip : -RRB-
re : can i drive to egypt without having triptec from ...
hi friend hope u will have a safe trip to egypt . yes , u need to get a trip ticket book from qatar riving club in c ring road with a qatari sponsorship . for ur car is still under installment , no problem to leave qatar but do n't ask the bank to give u a letter to leave qatar with ur car . also , u must have a valid qatari license and u must make car insurance in the saudi border and it will cost u 75/00 saudi riyals per trip . u have two ways to reach egypt . 1a - thru deba to hurghada by a high speed fairy boat and the trip will last for 4 hours approx . 1b - thru deba to safaga and it will take about 12hours and i dont prefer it . 2 - thru jordan from al aqaba to sharm el sheikh and the trip will take about 6 hours by sea . i hope that the above information is useful to u and it will help u to take the right direction .

aptech is a fine choice for introductory photoshop lessons .
if you have never worked on
if you have never worked on photoshop before , the best would be to first get ur hands dirty with online tutorials and get yourself familiar with the menu 's and just the basic working of the software . youtube is the best source . problem with going for short courses is that they just skim through everything quickly giving u an introduction , showing you what the menus do and other such options nothing useful . . all of which you can learn online for free . once you feel you are good with the basics just enroll yourself for more advanced course where you will fully unleash the power of photoshop ... thats just my opinion for value for money . : p

souq faleh is the abaya souq . it is on the same road as souq jaber , it is closer to the western union . there are about 100 shops in there or more , and you can get readymade or pick a design and they will sticth it for you . you can get a modest abaya for around qr 150 and a more elaborate stich for around 300-400 . abayas in this souq can go for thousands but it depends on how elaborate you want it . bargain the price , be relentless , if you dont suceed in one shop go to the next . _____________________________________________________ `` diplomacy is the art of saying ` nice doggie ' until you can find a rock - will rogers ''

well , it depends upon your budget . you could try asian -LRB- located opposite airport , besides pizza hut -RRB- . they have a big hall that can certainly allocate 30 people easily . or else , try osra -LRB- mannai-roundabout -RRB- , they too have a hall you can throw a party . if ur budget is big , then i think u can rent out taj resoi at marriot .

money is not an issue . . i need a grand one ... where we can conduct some games & all . . taj rasoi . . can it accomodate 30 ppl ???

if money is not an issue then try alishan , hediard and bateel . there is a great lebanese restaurant in the pearl -LRB- burj al hamam -RRB- but very expensive . you should also try the sanjiv kapoor 's restaurant in souq waqif .

re : exit permit ? is it for real ?
it is for real
re : exit permit ? is it for real ?
yest is true . we normally have to apply a week in advance for an exit visa . btw they are not allowed to refuse you an exit visa -LRB- supposedly ! -RRB-
re : exit permit ? is it for real ?
for everything you need sponsor letter/approval ... ups you can go to the wc without asking . . or to make sure you dont run away from your job or bank loans . sponsor has to put up the fees for visa ticket and they want guarantee you stay for the contract period .
re : exit permit ? is it for real ?
you can have your sponsor issue a yearly exit permit but you may have to pay for it -LRB- few hundreds qr -RRB-
re : exit permit ? is it for real ?
well in bahrain and uae they re lucky to live without it , its disappointing coz i was considering qatar as the next destination , m not sure anymore
re : exit permit ? is it for real ?
if you are lucky your company may grant you a multi exit visa , it lasts for 12 months and costs 100qr
re : exit permit ? is it for real ?
no reven , it cost 500qr . i have it .

hello i want to get driving licence . when i enquired at driving school they told me to do eye test and learner 's licence . where is authorised center to do eye test ? can i get learner 's licence in one day ? regards , naveen
re : get learner 's licence
no , of course not ! you can not get the license in one day ! if that actually happens for you , then it 's completely unfair to the rest of us who worked hard and long to get a license ! you need patience ...
re : get learner 's licence
even in lulu hypermarket there is eye testing . . unit in the optical shop .

most of the optical shops are authorized for eye test , and when you join a driving school they will arrange learners licence same day . but if you are going for direct test , it is not so easy .

re : profession change
hi , changing your category of work can be done provided you are receiving not less than 7,250 qr and you have to certify thru bank salary transfer for the last three months of your salary . at the same time your sponsor must allow you to change your status . at any given time you can apply for this . not to mention you have to proved your education attainment like diploma/certificate and transcript certified by your embassy . hope i help you with this , good luck and be well
re : profession change
my question , are u doing an engineer job , if not how u expect ur sponsor to change ur profession ? my second question , why people agree to come on such visa if their level is higher than that .
re : profession change
mr.salah i am doing my engineering design jobs from last few months with present company and earning good salary too . previously , my company offered a job and sent to me employment visa and at that time i couldnot realize waht is mentiond in the visa . anyways i thankfull you all for your valuable advices . . if anuthing more please drop down for me ...

if you have a water heater : turn off water heater -LRB- boiler -RRB- in your bathroom or kitchen . this water will remain room temperature . so , use cold water -LRB- blue part of tap -RRB- as hot water and red one as cold water -LRB- oposite to what you do in winter -RRB- when water heater is on .

can you wear shorts in public in qatar ?
my family and i are moving to qatar next year . we lived in saudi 10 years ago . a co-worker said expat men and women can wear shorts in public in qatar . i find that extremely difficult to believe . what 's the truth ? thanks , kevin in houston
re : can you wear shorts in public in qatar ?
generally , it 's not the done thing . my husband , a carefree sort , wears knee-length shorts to the mall . but my teenage son got accosted my a couple of non-gulf arabs when he wore shorts to the mall - so trousers for him .
re : can you wear shorts in public in qatar ?
yes , you can wear shorts , just not really short indecent shorts . they should be to the knee and shoulders need to be covered ie no singlet tops for either men or women however many ex-pats do flout this .
re : can you wear shorts in public in qatar ?
it really depends where in public you go . on your compound or to your kids school is perfectly fine . i see shorts in all the malls . but really , it is considered offensive in this culture , and while you wo n't get arrested , you will get stared at .
re : can you wear shorts in public in qatar ?
all the answers above are correct ; qatar is less conservative than ksa but not nearly as open as uae or bahrain . it 's a great place in the middle . as a man wear your `` boy pants '' you 'll be fine ; as a woman same , but more importantly keep the shoulders covered . you 'll be comfortable and wo n't get a second look . coming from houston , welcome to the nearest corollary weather-wise ... !
re : can you wear shorts in public in qatar ?
just do n't wear short shorts , we do n't want to see the little guy pop out .
re : can you wear shorts in public in qatar ?
wear anything qatar is not conservative and mad like ksa .

living in hmc compound - what 's it like ?
hi all we are currently living in cardiff uk , my husband has been offered a senior management role with hamad medical corporation . i am wondering what living in a company compound is like ... what kind of standards are the villas ? is there a community feel ? what is there to do ? thanks in advance for you help and comments !
hi . my husband works for
hi . my husband works for hamad . we are living in a beautiful villa in a compound full of hmc staff . what is great is that all the husbands , and a couple of wives , work in the same department so they are all generally good friends . the facilities in our comound are limited -LRB- pool and gym only -RRB- however the social life makes up for it . what i do however , suggest is getting out and meeting other people when you arrive so that you have variety to your day . contact me if you like . i have a 2 year old son who is always keen for play dates . best regards , p1x13

they donot provide
they donot provide accomodation in compound for couples . nly for pplz who are single here but if he bring you here then he will get housing allownce worth 5000qr if he is just a nurse but if he is a doc then more and he can find house anywhere he want . . dont worry depends on him he choose a compound or he request for cash . better to get cash coz house for 2 to 3 rooms are just 4000qr good class home . if you want xelent house then just start adding money . .
thanks
yes i have of course checked the hmc website - it is a little dry , i was hoping for some personal perspective . thank you for your comment kashoo . in his discussions with his new boss-to-be my husband has been told that he will have a villa in the compound -LSB- so i hope there is room for me ! :--RRB- -RSB-
living in hmc compound .
some years ago many hmc senior staff were housed in two-story detached villas in al messila compound on the rayyan road . some do still live there but i do n't know whether villas are still allocated to new staff . the houses are good and , like most compounds here , the recreational facilities provided are quite good -LRB- social centre , swimming pool , tennis courts , etc -RRB- . i am sure that you will be able to live comfortably here . however , if you have pets , make sure that the compound will permit them , some do not .

bernadette . , ya wel come . i know all about hmc coz my friends are working there and when i was posting reply for u she was with me so i asked here and i posted for you . . dont worry . . btw why room for u alone ? arnt u r the wife ?? : d

anyone lost a golden retriever ???
we just picked up a golden retriever -LRB- friday 11h30am -RRB- of c ring road near the airport . anyone know of someone who lost his dog ??? looks like a domesticated dog with leash and collar still attached . pls contact me on 688 6924 or 588 5632
re : anyone lost a golden retriever ???
i hope this dog has a family looking for him . sadly in dukhan we had had 2 retreivers dumped last week , they are very friendly and socialised and obviously used to belong to someone . this is exactly why i get sad by the changing fashions of dog breeds here , this time last year everyone wanted a golden retriever . good luck , i hope you find his owners or a nice home for him .
re : anyone lost a golden retriever ???
jasmine - that is so sad to hear . why do people do this ? you are giving your dog a death sentence of slowing starving and dying in a cruel way . these dogs do not know how to fend for themselves ... the dog i found is about 10 years old and has been part of a family . how cold hearted must you be to just dump him and leave . i can not keep him for much longer as i have 4 cats who are so stressed out and living in my bedroom - it ; s not fair on them . i will keep him until after new year incase his family has gone on vacation and the maid does not know where to look . after that he will need to be re-homed . not sure how to go about it but have already spoken to kelly at qaws . she is a star ...

i know its so silly to ask . but , i just want to be sure . my son and i came here on a family visa which is issued by qatar petroleum . after all the processing , we 've got our rp . i could ` nt read its in arabic . in my rp says `` family '' my question is ... who is our sponsor ? qp or my husband ? a drop of reassurance will be highly appreciated .
re : sponsor
no need exit permit if your family is under your sponsership only check the validity of their resident permit
re : sponsor
your husband is the qp staff so qp is his sponcer as his family you have the family visa under hs -LRB- ur husband -RRB- sponcership.you are free to find job & work here , free to travel home anytime as you dont need any exit permit all this as long as your husband is working in qp.once he decide to leaves his job or country your sponcership automatically stands cancelled & you will have to leave the country as well
re : sponsor
you are under sponsor of your husband ... your husband is under sponsor of qp company ... if the company will cancel the visa of your husband automatic ur visa will be cancel as well as ur son
re : sponsor
first time visa processing is normally done by the employer -LRB- in this case your husband 's sponsor -RRB- . however your husband is your sponsor .
how much a car like chevy aveo for rent for 1 year ?
hi how much does a car like chevy aveo can be had on rental for a year . ? also is there any hidden charges with * terms and conditions ? who is the best rental company here ? thanks rgds sri
re : how much a car like chevy aveo for rent for 1 year ?
i agree with above members . you are better off buying a car than renting and just sell it when you are ready to leave qatar even at a loss you are still saving a bunch and protecting yourself from those '' special terms and conditions '' .
re : how much a car like chevy aveo for rent for 1 year ?
if aint wrong...15-17 .000 qr/year . with this amount you can buy tomorrow one aveo model 2003-2006 . after 1 year , you can sell it with 10-12000 qr ! be smart !
re : how much a car like chevy aveo for rent for 1 year ?
drac is correct !
re : how much a car like chevy aveo for rent for 1 year ?
the rent a car monthly may cost between 1500 -2000 depending on the condition of the car , and if it is fully insured or third party , there are several car rent company , all are same , but you need to check all the terms and condition before renting one and special terms that are related to car accident
re : how much a car like chevy aveo for rent for 1 year ?
lol !! you guys have to stop renting cars for such long periods . almost all the instructors in my college had rented cars , some for even 2 years ... really really dumb . even if you dont know the whereabouts in a new country you are already posting a question in a website where you can sell your cars . even if your considerng the lose you 'll be facing when selling your car , its still going to be better then just paying the full amount of the car & then just walking away . you 'll atleast get half of the price back .
re : how much a car like chevy aveo for rent for 1 year ?
still if you want to rent . try calling euro dollar . they can give you affordable rent per year plus good service as well . number is 4351397 . goodluck !

qatari national day is on a friday , do we give a working day off ?
hello , the qatari national day festival is on a friday -LRB- 18/12/2009 -RRB- . since it is an official holiday as per local regulations , do we have to give a working day off to workers -LRB- i.e. let them off the following saturday -RRB- ? please answer only if you know the answer officially not on a guessing basis . thanks .

re : qatari national day is on a friday , do we give a. . .
yes we do have off on sunday ...
re : qatari national day is on a friday , do we give a. . .
i wish we could get 1 day holiday either thursday or sunday ... i hope its sunday :d that is for government and/or semi-government . but for private companies who have work on friday ... and working in retails ... i doubt if they will give you off-day , they will just consider it overtime for you , or add it to your annual vacation leave .
re : qatari national day is on a friday , do we give a. . .
the labour law clearly says eid and qatar national day should be working day , so if the holiday falls on friday this day should carry forward to next working day , if your company working on saturday it should be saturday , if friday-saturday off should be sunday , unfortunately some companies are not following any rules which gets any benifits to employees , you work . . work ... work ... we earn when we feel you dont need simply go . . when you find any good job with better salary can say `` no release '' . sponsorship law should be revised or you dont have any right as a human being , your life is controlled by a company or a sponsor ??!! no freedom of movement .

fireworks
hey there - i was wondering of anyone knew if there would be any fireworks anywhere this evening for new year - we are spending a relatively quiet night in with the family but wondered of it would be worth making it up to the roof at midnight eg - if any hotels were doing fireworks that we may be able to see from the al sadd area thanks in advance xxx
no fireworks , now new year celebration !
stay put in your room , get fat and sleep . work on 1st january . just get use to it bro . ; -RRB-
@ps ...
dont u think its too late to celebrate it ... lol !
yeah , it 's late to celebrate
yeah , it 's late to celebrate it but it 's worth celebrating it with people important to you than celebrate on time alone.right ? cheers !

are you a qatari national ?
are you a qatari national ? how old are you ? the best advice that one can give you is to fisrtly - think about what it really is that you want to do in life . what are you good at ? if you are unsure ... sometimes it helps to see a careers advisor . they are tests that you can take , which identify your strengths and weaknesses , and that can ultimately help you pursuing a career in line with your unique talent . if you do n't have anyone you can talk to , e-mail me more details about yourself , and maybe i can direct you a little ;o-RRB- bebeuk@gmail.com
as bea said , do what you are
as bea said , do what you are good at . . not even what you would love to do , but what you are able to do ... if i want to be a singer , but do n't have a good voice , my only desire without the talent is not gon na help me ... if i want to be a finance manager , but i could barely pass the math exam in the school , my only desire without the talent is not gon na help me . . if i want to be a basketball player , but i am 1m60cm , my only desire without being gifted is not gon na help me ... chose whatever you like out of what you are good at ...
do you want to continue
do you want to continue studies further or want to join some short diploma / certificate courses ? i have suggested you earlier , go for some ticketing & computer courses in the q/a section , as it 's in demand . but register your self as a private candidate for further studies as well . get at least a bachelor 's degree ... it 's my advice : -RRB-

i want to know it is possible to take a 42 '' lcd tv as a accompanied luggage .
i have purchased a 42 '' lcd tv and want to take it to india as accompanied luggage by qatar airways . is it possible or not ? . pl.any one can answer to me.the size of the tv original packing is 130cm x 20cm x 70cm .
re : i want to know it is possible to take a 42 '' lcd tv as ...
yes . it will count towards your luggage allowance so you may not be able to take much else unless you pay excess baggage !
re : i want to know it is possible to take a 42 '' lcd tv as ...
inquire airline before departure about the size and weight of box . keep the bill handy for custom clearence .
re : i want to know it is possible to take a 42 '' lcd tv as ...
allowed for up to 32 inch . above the limits can be done through cargo
re : i want to know it is possible to take a 42 '' lcd tv as ...
hi , you can take 42 '' lcd tv , but its total weight with box must be less than 32kg and size as per airport rules and price should be less than 25000 irs , so that you will not pay customs.if the tv is bought recently than its possible because all new , and latest models are slim and weighing less , i took one to india recently in month of july . bye
re : i want to know it is possible to take a 42 '' lcd tv as ...
yes you can ... just ensure it is carfefully packed though and allow time at check in

recommended hotel or apartment in dubai ?
hi , i plan to go dubai with family -LRB- 2 adults and 1 baby -RRB- for holiday on may . can anyone please recommend a good and reasonable price of hotel or apartment in dubai ? preferably close to emirates mall . . convenience . budget about 200-400qr per night . thank you .
re : recommended hotel or apartment in dubai ?
this might help you http://www.booking.com/searchresults.html?sid=ab91593fd937507d6e68093121408810;class_interval=1;idf=1;offset=0;score_min=0;si=ai%2cco%2cci%2cre%2cdi;ss_all=0;;city=-782831;origin=disamb;srhash=2994667059;srpos=1
re : recommended hotel or apartment in dubai ?
try millenium airport hotel , it is 5 minutes from the airport and 500 meters from gigico metro station . i paid around 400 ryials per night for a double room through expedia.com the hotel is 4 stars with nice and spacious rooms and good service . and one piece of advice , use the metro , it is cheap , reliable and will take you to all interest points including emirates mall and mall of dubai . have a nice trip and let me know if you need other info
re : recommended hotel or apartment in dubai ?
that would be a 2-3 star hotel . moe -LRB- mall of emirates -RRB- is accessible if you 're going by dubai metro . i would suggest that you stay near deira city -LRB- rather than on that area if you plan to stroll around -RRB- . you 'll have more access to malls like deira city center , dubai mall -LRB- near tall burj khalifa and the awesome water fountain -RRB- and creek park -LRB- dolphinarium etc. . . -RRB- and not really far from the airport ... suggestions that would fit your budget -LRB- that i know -RRB- : deira city center hotel , city seasons hotel , ibis deira city center , novotel hotel .
re : recommended hotel or apartment in dubai ?
thank you very much for your suggestion . any other recommend area beside deira ? can i drive in dubai with qatar driving license ?
waqif art center closed ?
heard a rumour that wac has closed down . is it true ? anyone know why ? seems a shame to close down one of the very few places of culture to be found in qatar . perhaps they need the space for another coffee chain outlet .
dunno when . seen it
dunno when . seen it mentioned by two different sources over he last few days . i only eat french kitkats now - le chitchat .

starbucks in doha
i 'm sure that doha is like dubai in the sense that there are bound to be a ton of starbucks all over the place . my question though . . is which one is the best for socializing ? where i 'm from in texas the starbucks i most frequented there was always a ton of people that you could randomly sit down with and have a chat . is there any place like that here ... other than a bar . ryan
err , i 'd be a little taken
err , i 'd be a little taken aback if a man came up to me in a doha starbucks and started a random chat and i 'm a westerner ! you need to go a little easy on that kind of thing here . mandi
what mandi said ^ ^ go on
what mandi said ^ ^ go on google/wiki and read up on middle eastern culture , or you going to get yourself into trouble . if i was you i 'd try to get involved with one of the local groups or go along to one of the bars . groups like the hash house harriers are often a way to meet new people , talk to baldrick on here .
lots of places to hang
lots of places to hang around here were you could randomly sit down and have a chat ... . desert-an area of land , usually in very hot climates , that consists only of sand , gravel , or rock with little or no vegetation , no permanent bodies of water , and erratic rainfall . desert-a place or situation that is devoid of some desirable thing or overwhelmed by an undesirable thing . . http://www.qatar-info.com for addl info .
wow ... youd be taken aback
wow ... youd be taken aback if someone starting talking to you ? even if ti was something of the sort `` what are you reading '' , '' where are you from '' i 'm not talking about plumping down in front of someone and starting up a conversation ... its more like if one presented itself . like you over hear an accent ... and your like . . hey where are you from ? thats what i mean ... if people in qatar cant handle that ... i guess i have 3 things in store for me ... a gym ... a book ... and xbox ... though i admit dont have one , but if i cant be randomly social ... video games seems the way to go ... hahaha ryan
a lot of guys used to go to
a lot of guys used to go to the one at ramada signal to meet other guys ... now they go to the beanery . besides , starbucks is so 2006 . no one goes anymore .

amish country huh ... well i
amish country huh ... well i dont think texas has amish ... and if we did ... they 'd have big trucks ... which would completely contradict their religion ... and in that case would no longer be amish . starbucks = 2006 ... well 2006 was a good year ... well maybe youre right ... i just wikipediad 2006 ... nothing really that eventful popped out ... oh god ... im so last year ... what to do with myself ryan

obliviously you are not gon na be the first texan here . . you are in the right place . . qatar living is the best place to socialize with like minded people ... be active here . . you will get to know people even before coming here ... provided you behave good . . lol talking to random people in starbucks is not a good idea . . lol they might ask ... ` why you wan na know what am reading ' ??

hey ryan - welcome to doha !!!! definately a big change from texas . the starbucks thing is definately a bit out of it now . atleast here in doha ... coffee is still rockin ' though so its an in-an-out thing ... columbiano coffee on cring by chili 's is actually pretty decent . i frequently plop myself down outside or on the nice comfy chairs and have coffee and a bit of lunch and internet surf ... great in the evenings after gym anyway -LRB- al massa is right behind -RRB- or on saturdays . ive struck up a few conversations here and there and ran into quite a few expats doing the same . good luck brin
welcome fellow texan
you will do great here . people are reserved , but i 've found if you smile and say hello , they will do the same . you may have to initiate the conversation , but many people will jump in if you start it . trust me , the endless coffee shops are thriving everywhere , starbucks , included . have a great adventure ... it 's what you make it . sybil <img src="http://www.kandjsupplies.com/animations/pics/animal_camel.gif" />

speaking of gyms and pick up trucks
i 've been in a tiny rental car since ive been in dubai ... and yesterday my company was like `` we 've got a big truck for you '' the truck they gave me was a toyota ... i dont know about you all ... but i dont think toyota knows the meaning of big ... nor do my british colleagues that i work with . a real truck is the kind in which you need a step latter to get into . hahaha gyms ... ok ... because ive been working so much i have eaten an abundant amount of crap . ie mcdonalds , burger king , etc. . . i think ive eaten more fast food in the past month than i have in the past 2 years ... anyway ... are there any good gyms to work out at there ? by good . . i mean , im used to a 24 hour fitness type , in which the gym is huge ... not a hotel fitness room . on a personal note ... i dont have a truck back home ... i have dodge charger ... and if i were to get a truckish type vehicle . . id go for a hummer ... even though they are most likely going out of business ryan

only americans smile in doha
texas is a very friendly place ... 1st thing you notice is here nobody smiles except with their friends ... people are not friendly and do not greet strangers with a smile and hi ; how are you ! people in this place have grim faces matching the dreary desert sand and oppressive heat and rough roads hey ; go to industrial area and you will have tons of fun :--RRB- lol
ryan , you may noticed that a
ryan , you may noticed that a lot of people do n't smile . perhaps you will notice also that ladies do n't smile at all. :-RRB- that 's because of cultural differences , i think . back home we smile to strangers , but here if a woman smiles to a man , he thinks you like him and stalks you . arghhhh ... oh , i know westerners do n't behave that way but unfortunately , westereners are not the only ones populating doha . cheers !
i do n't know if you have
i do n't know if you have children ryan from texas but if you do and they say please and thank you they will be laughed at here in qatar ! take them to one of the amusement areas and see how rude the children are here and how they have no respect for lines -LRB- queues -RRB- and no courtesy at all

fs i do n't know what ur talking about . . ive lived here all my life and ppl always seem to be friendly i have never come across some guy being rude or obnoxious for no reason with me . . there r the occasional morons at the cinema etc. . but in general i think every here is pretty decent n respectful ... <span class="inline left"> <img class="image preview" src="/files/images/coollogo_com_882831935.preview.gif" alt="" width="237" height="58" /> </span>
loathe as i am to make
loathe as i am to make generalization , i disagree bahraini . compared to other countries , people are not as friendly to strangers in qatar . compared to other countries - they smile much less . compared to other countries - people here are obnoxious , disrespectful to service staff in cafes , restaurants , shops , disrespectful of queues , non-smoking signs , use of mobile phones in cinames , and children here , particularly arab kids , are the rudest little brats i 've ever seen . compared to other countries - no , they are on the whole not friendly to strangers . try living in a western country and you 'll see the difference . people form orderly queues in traffic , at the movies , in shops , everywhere . they do n't smoke indoors . they say please and thank you .
fubar -- exactly
bahraini and others that think that this is a `` friendly '' and `` respectable '' place are not on the outside looking in ...

i love starbucks !!
pm - is ramada signal where the gmc garage is ? and the starbucks is next door to johhny rockets ? ryan - if the answer to the above question is yes , then i would say this is a good place to start . i am from the uk and everytime we drive past that starbucks its always fairly busy - no jam packed , but busy enough , and i always say to my husband `` lets stop there for a coffee '' . we have gone there a couple of times and although i have only been here just over 2 weeks , i think it will be my new hangout . just listen to conversations and you can pick out the english speakers from the none english speakers - although i havent noticed anyone reading books here yet , which is a shame ... maybe me and you could start a trend ! :-RRB- in our old flat in the uk we used to have a starbucks just a 5 minute walking distance away and i used to go there so regularly that i became pally with the staff and if i wasnt always in a rush , i would have probably made a few friends as well . i am like you , i always want to strike up a conversation with randoms because people interest me and i believe that you never know who you are going to meet . at the end of the day , dont let this thread scare you off meeting people - ok , if they are wearing abayas , perhaps not , but i have found when you speak to people here , they are usually very friendly , more friendly than dubai even ! -LRB- i have never been to texas so ca n't comment on that neck of the woods ! -RRB-

dont panic ! go to madina khalifa traffic dept and ask for eveidence of traffic vilation they will provide you the copy of the picture taken by the radar or if manual it will have the details of the place where violation done with the detail of the officer who booked it simple just check it to make sure than if not your car argue your case . good luck
re : traffic violation ?
try to recollect the events and your standard practice of driving in the past few days that some traffic police man is hiding such a way that u would have not noticed and they will take note of irregularities such as speaking in mobiles , non tightning seatbelts , such and such is like that and will be recorded in their system and message may be automated subsequently to appear in ur mobile on this particular day . if u are very much sure , just try madeenat khalifa and ask for evidences convincing the situation as you believe now that you have not moved out the car on this particular day . good luck
re : traffic violation ?
it could be a parking violation .

help ... psp downgrade ... help
help ... ... ... i just bought psp slim made in japan with 4.01 firmware . it showed psp-2000 model on the hardware . i tried to downgrade to be able to play game in memory , but still have not luck . borrowed pnadora battery from friend , when i plug it the system never come out . it keep blinking the green on battery side . anybody could help to guide or help me to solve the problem ?
re : help ... psp downgrade ... help
hey ! you dont have to go to souq . i can fix your problem if your using a psp slim . ^_^
re : help ... psp downgrade ... help
pandora battery + magic memory stick = jailbreak . pandora battery alone will not jailbreak it ... you nead the mms with the custom firmware to load and flash your eeprom .
re : help ... psp downgrade ... help
unfortunately , there are n't any available hacks for the fw version 4.01 yet . yes , it 's the same psp 2000 but it 's the newer batch sony produced with a different motherboard . so basically we have to wait for the hack to be develop , same goes for the psp-3000 .
re : help ... psp downgrade ... help
seek advice from sony . goodluck !
re : help ... psp downgrade ... help
maybe you didnt do the right procedure to downgrade ur psp ? ^ ^
re : help ... psp downgrade ... help
you should take out the pandora battery first after downgrading your psp . then use the ac adaptor or your original battery for your psp to install the cfw .
what is the difrence between visit and work visas
who can -LRB- kindly -RRB- explain the difference between visit and work visas ... the plusses and minuses ... pls
re : what is the difrence between visit and work visas
visit visa is limited for months which if you have if family you can stay up to 6 month in a year and if you have work visa you can stay here for 1 year
re : what is the difrence between visit and work visas
main difference is that a visit visa holder can not work whether paid or unpaid . whiles a work visa holder can work and stay here as long as the sponsor wish . he need to renew your resident permit every year paying nominal fee .
re : what is the difrence between visit and work visas
work visa : enables u to work for a company -LRB- private or international -RRB- for a period of 1-3years -LRB- depending on ur company -RRB- in qatar . visit visa : keeps u in the country from a period of 14days-6months , but not empowered for work purposes in qatar .
re : what is the difrence between visit and work visas
visit visa is only limited time maximum of 6 month and legaly a visitor can not work . where as work visa you can work and duration depend for how many years sponser make residency . usually minimum for 1 year and maximum for 5 years .
re : what is the difrence between visit and work visas
visit vs. work visa 1 . 6 months no extension 1 year renewable each year 2 . purpose is to visit purpose is to work as simple as that .
re : what is the difrence between visit and work visas
by the way work visas are also called work visit visa these days . so that makes all the types of visas ` visit ' visas only , so which type of visit visas difference you are looking .

carpet cleaning dublin
engaging a carpet cleaning service could become mandatory if you have carpets at home . considering they are always exposed to the outdoor environment , accumulation of dust and grime is a common affair . for the first few months , vacuum cleaning will solve the problem .
local carpet cleaning
hiya , some advice . make sure that you hire local carpet cleaning companies , for 2 reasons . . firstly , economics ... the money spend on a local company means that the monies will be re-distributed local . the second is the reputation of the cleaning company ... a local firm have to live within your community , so their reputation is on the line thus ensuring that the job will be done to a high standard . _________________________________________________ <a href="http://www.arcticcleaning.ie"> cleaning companies dublin </a> <a href="http://www.arcticcleaning.ie"> carpet cleaning dublin </a> <a href="http://www.arcticcleaning.ie"> window cleaning dublin </a>

married couple coming for a visit
hi everyone , my friends who are both married to each other would like to visit me in qatar . we were planning for them to stay with me . i am a single man with two bedrooms . is it acceptable for them to stay in the other bedroom or would that be against muslim laws ?
re : married couple coming for a visit
you have ` nt mention about your friends ... are they muslims ? i do n't think so any one should have objection on it . . they are not only ur friends they r ur guest too so give them respect .
re : married couple coming for a visit
kindly dont indulge every matter of life with muslims . why anyone here have objection to stay with you , if they have visa & other legal formalities for qatar . do you still think ... ... ... ?
re : married couple coming for a visit
there is no law that prohibits you from entertaining a married couple . there is however always the possibility of some narrrow minded person making an objection . this would invariably be a fellow expat who wishes to make a statement in an attempt to draw attention to him/herself . 99.9 % safe .

need expert advice
i have an impt question and need expert feedback . if the last day of annual leave is immediately followed by 3 days of eid holidays , are these 3 days considered as part of annual leave ? in my company the hr dept. calculates the 3 days as extension of annual leave and hence leave without pay . is this correct as per the law ? experts pls guide .
no , its a public holiday . so
no , its a public holiday . so you have get paid for that .
no way . . dont keep quiet .
no way . . dont keep quiet . how can eid holidays be leave without pay ? gift a copy of qatar labour law to your hr department . if they still persist to cut your salary go and see the labour department officials ... thy will help you .
some people going vacation
some people going vacation this september , trying to negotiate with the company to extend 3 days from their planned vacation . for example they were supposed to start vacation by sept 10 and comeback by oct. 10 -LRB- 1 month vacation -RRB- and the eid holidays will be from 21-24 , they usually come back by oct. 13 . something like that .
labour law : article -LRB- 78 -RRB-
the worker shall be entitled to annually , leave with full wage as follows : 1 . three working days for eid ei-fitr 2 . three working days for eid al-adha 3 . one working day for the independence day 4 . three working days to be specified by the employer .
not all companies fall under
not all companies fall under the labour law troll , you work in the ministry you should know that . qp , rasgas , al jazeera etc and the rest of the government are not governed by the labour law , they are governed by their own policy with civil law be the deciding factor . if you are on leave during a holiday , that day is counted as your annual leave . if you return from leave and resume work for one day prior to the eid holiday then it will not be counted as annual leave . same goes for maternity leave . annual leave is paid leave and an public holidays that fall within it are not counted as extra days unless your company has specific policy in this regard . ____________________________________________________ `` diplomacy is the art of saying ` nice doggie ' until you can find a rock - will rogers ''

re : turkey/istanbul travel
no need for a travel agent for tours . just book the cheapest flight and go directly to sultanamet in istanbul . all the sights are conveniently located in that area and there are dozens of hotels that you can chose there and then . we just used the map and walked everywhere !!! yeh we didnt need to waste money on taxis or othe transport . let me warn you that mid june and jult gets very hot and humid but the monuments are certainly worth it . we even walked to the bosporous from our hotel -LRB- hotel ambassador -RRB- and bought the ticket there and then , for the boat ride so no need to spend extra by buying the ticket from a tour operator . istanbul is beautiful and the kids and i loved it . cant wait to go back .
re : turkey/istanbul travel
lamea has given you excellent advise . we had a lovely trip 2 years back . all major attractions are walking distance in sultan ahmet . we spent 3 days in istanbul , then took a tour from one of the local tour operators and spent 12 days exploring cappadokia , pammukale , kusa desi , troy etc. it was great ... we learnt a lot about history , did a lot of trekking , me , my wife & 3 kids loved the tour . the 12 days trip costed me 1000 euros and about 500 in istanbul . call me if u need more info ... cheers zak -LRB- 6646-8056 -RRB-
re : turkey/istanbul travel
wow . . thank you everyone . yes , actually my plan is to travel and explore istanbul by ourself and get a local tour for trip to cappadocia and pamukkale . or is it a good idea to travel to cappadocia and pamukkale without tour guide as well ?? we will be travel to turkey on end of september . i believe the weather is nice on that month .
re : turkey/istanbul travel
turkey is a mountain country , so travel by train and coach is slow ... i bought the package from a local tour operator in istanbul -LRB- sultan ahmet area -RRB- . all tour operators give u the same package i.e. the hotel accomo is same ... but the ones on the main street are twice expensive compared to the ones in side streets . we took a luxury coach from istanbul at night and arrived early morning in capadokia ... then took coach to pammukale -LRB- 6hrs -RRB- ... it was comfortable and pleasant ... you can research about turkey on the internet . you dont need a translator ... the tour operator will give u the itinerary for your trip and when u arrive at hotel they tour guide will collect you and they speak good english . when u are in capadokia please take the hot air baloon safari ... its a great experience to see the chimneys from above ... leave the kids in the hotel because its expensive . cheers

safety in doha-qatar
hi , everyone , could you help me to describe about safety environment in doha-qatar ?? it 's safe or not , especially for woman and expatriate ? thank you . . ^ ^
re : safety in doha-qatar
safe as mom 's arms -LRB- for the time being that is -RRB- .
re : safety in doha-qatar
qatar is practically a safe place to live in . no worries that you will be ganged up in the street at night , or robbed in your home . women are much respected here . i like the way they are being prioritized in long lines at the supermarkets . as long as a woman dress up decently , she will not invite any uninvited stares .
re : safety in doha-qatar
women are very much pampered here if you walking alone one will hear horns or flashing lights of posh cars slowing down and asking for a lift . . so take care !!! safe stay in doha . . it also happens to young boys even ...
re : safety in doha-qatar
hai sylvia i have been a staying in doha for eight years and till now i did n't had any bad experience ... i felt it perfectly safe to go out even at night and dine out and shopping ... everything is fine till now ... if you dress properly and behave decently , you earn respect and care ...
re : safety in doha-qatar
safety here in qatar is very well ... where country you will see that police not have guns , , , , , only here in middle east .

signs of autism
i have a 2.5 years old son with a delay in speech . i wonder this is a sign of autism . is there a doctor in doha who can help me . please help me .
go to hmc
you better go to hmc opd they will give u an appointment to pediatrician , then dr will refer u to rumailla . in rumailla they will help u by giving speech therophy for ur child . dont worry here in hmc they will help u a alot . hope ur son will talk soon ...
signs of autism
speech delay alone is not a sign of autism . there are other signs . i would highly recommend that you go to shafalllah centre for an assessment , and if he is diagnosed there as autistic or just speech delay , you can go to qatar autism centre for private one-to-one sessions , but this depends on your budget , rumaila 's problem is that they have very busy schedules and they give you only one session per week and they depend on the parents to continue at home but they are supported by hamad so you do not pay a lot for this session . but in qatar autism centre , it is not supported but they can give you up to 3 times a week and during the evening and not during working hours as in rumaila ! good luck !
thanks all for your support .
thanks all for your support .

planning to ship uk right hand drive car

driving is the least of my problems
i 've spent the last year driving the car -LRB- right hand drive uk spec -RRB- in holland , germany -LRB- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwttrcgix58 -RRB- , france and italy -LRB- which are all left hand drive countries -RRB- ; so sitting on the wrong side is the least of my problems - it is damned easy . i 've already started driving in doha -LRB- in a crappy company car -RRB- and the driving here is easy , too . as to whether or not the spec of the car is suitable to be driven in qatar without modifications to ac etc , i shall find out when i call mercedes , tomorrow . i know that a lot of the specs are above gcc specs -LRB- i.e. emissions , airbags , safety rating etc -RRB- . however , if bringing the car over is simply a legal impossibility , then i 'll save my time . <b> that </b> is the purpose of my question . so , i ask again ; can i bring it over , and if so , how ? given the credit crunch , it is impossible to sell for a reasonable return , so i 'd rather keep it out here . thanks

i am glad you think everything is so easy , i personally find driving here a bit more difficult than london . i guess i am just thick . seeing as you are finding everything so easy , go to the ministry and ask them if you can do it . that 's what i did .
can the car be imported , or not ?
i thought the question was pretty straight forward . indeed , i shall make all the necessary inquiries regarding the car 's spec , before making my final decision . however , at this time , all i want to know is if it is <b> possible </b> to do it . a simple <b> yes </b> or <b> n </b> o would do . if yes , then the appropriate measures to do so would be a nice addition . beyond that , whether i wish to risk <i> my </i> car 's paint work , rubber , plastic , ac etc will be a decision that i 'll take later . thanks

can you import a car or not ? : -RRB-
i may be moving to quatar in may 2009 . i have the same questions as shaunconnor and musashi : 1 . - can you import a car to quatar or not ? 2 . - what is involved ? is it a headache not work taking on or can it be done ? 3 . - what import duty , if any , applies ? my car is a right-hand drive bmw and i am considering bringing it simply because i like driving it . i do n't think heat or sand will be a problem , given that the car has been at home in louisiana , texas , new mexico and arizona .
go ahead
go ahead , new experiance .

planning to ship uk right hand drive car
musashi please let me know if you get a proper response since i am in the same boat and for whatever reason i am unable to sell my car in the uk due to massive negative equity amd really must bring to qatar all i need to know is it allowed - irrespective of the cost
i dont they they will allow
i dont they they will allow rhd 's in qatar . earlier it was permitted . from the 90s onwards i think they have stopped giving permission
it is not allowed to import
it is not allowed to import rhd cars anymore .

this can be arduous and many have to be tested before the final choosing of the `` best '' one-however once decided upon , their performance can rapidly decline to an unacceptable level . these must be discarded and traded in for better models asap otherwise there can be very high maintenance costs !!!

bahraini-its a world wide problem !!
i have been 2 many places and seen and tried many milkshaking machines and they all work wonderfully whilst shiny and new . they soon drop in performance , and this is not anything to do with the manufacturing country ! the only way to prevent this is to be able to afford many different models and use them infrequently to prevent wear !!
sounds like an experts
sounds like an experts opinion . . mind telling me about the best and the long lasting ones ?

there are actual milkshake blenders but these are not practical as all you can do is ... well , make milkshakes . you are much better off with a hand blender . they have a deep measured glass you can make milkshakes , smoothies etc in , and if you want you can also use it to blend soups and such . there is a very nice moulinex one that has attachements for chopping and grinding but it runs about 600 + qr , but very handy . i myself have a small black and decker which cost under 200 . ____________________________________________________ `` diplomacy is the art of saying ` nice doggie ' until you can find a rock - will rogers ''

re : problem skin
hi ! i have break outs a few months back , no doubt exacerbated by the weather , dust and food here . before , i used to have few pimples but it was hormonal -LRB- i only have pimples after college already -RRB- so my ob-gyn prescribed a low dose birth control pills for me -LRB- diane -RRB- . it worked actually but since i do n't want to be under medication on anything for a long time , i stopped taking the meds . i tried lots of over the counter products but not all of them worked as advertised . now , i 'm using st. ive 's facial scrub -LRB- gentle -RRB- , followed by an exfolliant / lightening product -LRB- extraderm-a filipino product -RRB- then moisturizer -LRB- olay complete -RRB- . thank fully , the break outs subsided . i guess , you have to use gentle products and stick with them if you are okay with them . -LRB- i have used clearasil before but it is not effective on my skin -RRB- then stay away from fried food esp . chicken and dusty places . i had a major breakout when i was still living in gharaffa which is very , very dusty . if you want first aid -LRB- when you have to go on dates or impt . functions -RRB- do these steps : 1 . clean face 2 . put ice on the pimple for about 10-20 mins . this will lessen the swelling . 3 . dip a piece of cotton on fresh lemon juice then placed it atop the pimple for about 5 mins . this will lessen the redness . feel free to pm me if you have further questions . .

re : problem skin
thanks guys , your advice is taken and compliments of the season to you all .
re : problem skin
rein a is effective but first you have to find something to peel the outer part of your skin ... this will make any over the counter cream effective . maxi peel is used for at least a month but avoid sun while using , better yet use only at night , and lots of moisturizers and sunblock in the day . peeling of the skin is good so as to take out all old skin where dirt hides and and when infection occurs , it freaks out there the pimples cause . but after few weeks of peeling , you can then proceed to retin - a for complete medication . chocolates or sweets or fries is not really the cause , but makes the pimples big it triggers to be big , itchy , red , and swell . avoid spicy too , drinking citrus juice helps to shrink them . if this pimples really big and all over your face and even at your back , better consult the doctor to take medicine intake , i forgot the name , but i will get back to you soon i remember

exit ... ... ... gcc ... ... . !
my friend was in saudi arabia for the one year . now under vacation in sri lanka . but he is not interested in going back to saudi due to some problems with employer . i think as per the rule he will be getting exit and cant go back to saudi for next two years to work under another employer . can he apply immediately for another gcc country or the saudi exit will effect all gcc countries .
if he is not blacklisted by
if he is not blacklisted by saudi , he can apply
he is not allowed ` dual gcc
he is not allowed ` dual gcc residency ' . if he does n't cancel his saudi visa it will automatically expire 6 months after his departure and then the ban time starts . if his visa is cancelled by his employer it goes straight into ban period -LRB- however long that is in saudi -RRB- . suggestion ? get a new passport to reenter another gcc country . have met many people during my stay in qatar who have done the same .
i had a couple of guys in our
i had a couple of guys in our company who were banned -LRB- not only cancelled -RRB- in uae and they got their qatari work visa with the same passport . only in some specific cases , the ban is imposed in all the gcc ... not in all . as far as the dual gcc residency is concerned ... i dont know about all the gcc but qatar allows you to keep both by paying a fee of qr 2000/year . the information is available on the moi 's website .
i doubt ... . . let him try his
i doubt ... . . let him try his luck !
he can apply to another
he can apply to another country in gcc if his saudi visa is cancelled .
that 's why
that is why they called it gcc , entire region of gulf countries . he can apply to any gcc country except saudi with his new passport . otherwise , noc is a requirement .
there might be a 6 month
there might be a 6 month period where he is banned in the gcc overall , but the 2 year is only applicable in the individual gcc country .
no ban in gcc , only in ksa .
no ban in gcc , only in ksa . he can still work in any other gcc , irrespective of the ban in ksa !

watch england v west indies
hey guys is there anywhere -LRB- preferably where i can have a beer ! -RRB- i can watch the england v west indies cricket game ? i was thinking champions in the marriott but its not actually a very nice bar in my opinion . any other hotels or one of the few licensed bars ? cheers
thanks luciano!i must admit ,
thanks luciano ! i must admit , i did n't make it to the ramada and did -LRB- sadly -RRB- end up in champions . the big problem with champions was the lack of sound as i like hearing the commentary . are we able to hear the commentary in ramada ? if not then i guess i will watch it in my hotel room . i wo n't be able to have a beer but i will at least really enjoy the cricket .
yeah that 's what i 'll do in
yeah that 's what i 'll do in the short term when in the company 's hotel apartment -LRB- got sky player so can watch most things live then -RRB- . would rather have all the sports channels when i get my only place
which hotel ? movenpick
which hotel ? movenpick towers is too slow to run anything useful . just about get away with tvcatchup but forget iplayer , 4od , sky go/player ... need too much bandwidth . : -LRB-
i 'll be staying in the asas
i 'll be staying in the asas twin towers apartments in west bay . obviously i 've not idea what they have there ! if the internet is too slow then it 'll have to be the pub for any sport until i sort my own place out when the wife comes over at the end of summer .
ok , so you should n't be too
ok , so you should n't be too far from the marriott then which will at the very least , cover the usual selection of sports . failing that , you also have the option of the ramada but that 's a bit further out of town -LRB- 5 each way in a cab -RRB- . i personally am not a big fan of champions -LRB- the marriott -RRB- but i will if i have to . also , as these pubs show many different sports they rarely put the sound on ... although they did for the footy the other night . of course , another option would be to go sit in champions with your laptop , stick your headphoness , tag on to the free wifi , fire up the vpn and order a beer ... ; -RRB-
ok thanks for the advice !
ok thanks for the advice ! i 'll be looking for somewhere decent to go for the euros , especially the england games . will be over after our first game . once i get my permanent place i 'll sort out my sports based tv package !

can i get a car -LRB- old or new -RRB- for rental for less than 1000 riyal
if any body know about any car less than 1000 riyal for rental , please answer me .
re : can i get a car -LRB- old or new -RRB- for rental for less than ...
the cheapest rate we had the last time we rented a car was for qr60 per day , honda civic 2005 . go to bin omran , there 's a corner there after badriya signal with lots of car rental services and i think you can bargain for a lower rate if you will rent for a month or more .
re : can i get a car -LRB- old or new -RRB- for rental for less than ...
you will get for 1000 riyal sure but for 15 days only ??!! you can rent a two wheeler for 1000 riyal , before you post such a idiotic question you should know the price of a vehicle and the market . if you can open car rental business for this price i am the one to fully book your vehicle first .
re : can i get a car -LRB- old or new -RRB- for rental for less than ...
1000 riyal per day . . sure . . why not ?

yes , but you will have to peddle with your feet through the hole in the bottom of the car . a bit like fred flintstone 's car .
work pace in doha
hi , my husband will start work in qatar soon and we were wondering how is the work pace there ? is it typical regular hours -LRB- 9 to 5 -RRB- or does it involve much of overtime / weekend work / anyone with insides from the financial sector would be very helpful ;--RRB- thanks . -LRB- sorry as i initially posted my question in the wrong place -RRB-
will depend where your
will depend where your husband is working , position and contract.typical working hours is 8 per day , as per labor law . mostly people in senior position do n't get paid ot .
depends entirely on your
depends entirely on your position and where you are coming from . the day typically starts much much earlier than in europe and somewhat earlier than the u.s. , but it also finishes earlier .
pace is slow , work pressure
pace is slow , work pressure has to be less than anywhere else in the world . working hours vary but unless he is working for a contracting company he will be free by 5 at max so your husband will have plenty of time for the family here .

mohammed good to know ;--RRB- we are planning to flight together , we are waiting for his work permit and we were assuming i can automatically go there . tks for clarifying .
sa165
you could fly together , but it would depend on your husband 's company in terms of what arrangements they could make for you . you would have to come in on a tourist or business visa . the latter is more convenient and will be valid for 3 months -LRB- although will have to be renewed once a month -RRB- . during this time , your husband 's papers should be sorted out , and he can then sponsor you as his family . your business visa would get converted . you could find work with your new residents ' visa . this is more advisable because once you are sponsored by your husband , you can take up or quit jobs like in the ` normal ' world . should you come here sponsored by a company , you 're stuck with them , no matter how badly things might go . and if you quit , you 'd have to leave the country and not come back for 2 years . it all sucks , but that 's how it is : - /

sa , do n't ask your company
sa , do n't ask your company for business visa , it is an incompliance issue , you r not eligible for business visa . whoever advise you to do so , advise you to violate the law . also company might not like it at all . you as a canadian can get visa upon arrival at doha airport , which is valid for 1 month and extendable for another month . once your hubs rp is finalized , he can sponsor you -LRB- check this point with his company prior to traveling ! -RRB- . as for changing a job , there are certain rules with regards to this matter . you as sponsored by you hub can quit/change the job any time . he can not change his sponsor any earlier than 1 -LRB- sometimes 2 -RRB- year/s . if he got so-called no objection certificate -LRB- noc -RRB- , he can change the company with no problem . ask him to check with his company whether providing a noc is in their policy or not . if no noc is granted , he has to leave the country for 2 years .
qatarisun
it is the companies themselves -LRB- both in my case and in that of several others that i know -RRB- that advise the business visa . but if tourist visa works as well for her , then it 's for the company to advise so . the business visa is renewable for up to 3 months and if needed , one can do a ` visa run ' out of qatar and come back to get another business visa valid for yet another 3 months . this makes it all much easier , because there 's no telling how long things take to get done here . especially with her husband 's rp . my friend 's took 3 months .
sa165
as far as leaving the company goes , like qatarisun said , this depends on the noc . usually , it is safe to assume that you would have to leave the country - or this is what i have heard from most people . in any case , getting an noc is not something to depend on , as you would never know until you 're actually at that stage . if you have a family here , you would n't really want to be coerced to leave and not come back , would you ? it really is best to wait to be sponsored by your husband . it takes a little patience and time , i know , but in the middle and long run , it 's a way better bet , all things considered . you must check with his company about how long before he can sponsor you - from what i understand , that varies with nationality and level of seniority . i know someone who was asked to wait 6 months before he could sponsor his wife - apparently qatar 's ` probation ' period :-RRB- anyway , for starters , get in here together on tourist/business visas -LRB- let the company hr advise on and handle that ... every company has different degrees of weight they can pull :-RRB- -RRB- , look around , settle down and wait till your husband can sponsor you . good luck !

salad chopper
hi , just happened to read on msn health that one of the 14 kitchen gadgets required for any '' healthy kitchen '' is the good grips salad chopper with bowl . does any one know if this is available in doha - if so where ? we do so love salad at home but are often deterred by not being able to chop the leaves into teeny weeny bits . ap

canned food might include many preservatives , additives , flavors , colorings . most are not natural products . rather artificial . i am talking about the eeeee 's family . i am not sure if there are any studies in this regard . but there are warnings about additives . check the ingredients and do some research about the e-family . here is a link to start with http://www.ukfoodguide.net/enumeric.htm in my opinion . a nice presentation has nothing to do with the way you prepare food . for example salad is usually a cocktail of vegetables , possibly some fruits , possibly cheese and ham . you can simply mamage a nice decoration for the top part and forget about the lower part . if you watch how jamie oliver prepares the food , you will be amazed . in no time he can prepare food and arrange a table with a nice variety and it looks yummy = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = http://www.qatarliving.com/node/58409

for the budget they have , one can send all hmc patients to mayo clinic and still have more money left . jci is a management accreditation , not quality . hmc dares to publish a survey showing how many of their top staff , or their families , actually use the service of hmc .
jci is a very good
jci is a very good accrediting body which provides correct tools and solutions to any healthcare organization . proper or actual use of those tools rests at the hands of the staff . 1 . implementation is such a different issue . that depends on the staffs ' intellect , willingness to adapt new processes , as well as their genuine service , not to mention that they should have real educations , not fake ones .
excellent
jci is directing all departments for the right procedures and policies.to be honest if jci is not visiting , there are enough staff just neglecting their work . that can be seen just before jci visit , their running everywhere . do n't know what to do.coz they were not working.if we do daily updates and follow procedures ccomplete our day-to-day work and responsibilities , we do n't have to scared of jci.what i noticed so many departments , heads are panic and updating everything only just before jci visit . i am really happy to have jci visit every month .

re : where can i get international driving license i am ...
first the international driving license is not a driving license , just a translation of your dl in several languages and should be provided by an official authority not by any web-based agency . second , this does not replace your dl , and you have to keep both documents with you . third , the qatar dl is not recognised in many countries , i just checked in france and belgium and this is not the case at the moment . so check before for every country you plan to visit , since in several countries you will not be allowed to drive . generally speaking it seems that it works with reciprocity , nationalities that have to pass the driving test here come from countries that do not recognize the qatari driving license . this might chance since it seems that obtaining the dl here is getting harder .

state of qatar does n't allow practice of homeopathy , tough luck .
that might not be the case
that might not be the case flexicode . from what i 've heard there are places here that do provide forms of natural/alternative medicine , which they call here ` ilaaj tabee-ee ' . i know that the boots store in uk stock homeopathic remedies but i 'm not quite sure about the boots here , but its still worth continuing to ask around or when in doubt call up 180 and ask if they have any numbers for places that practice natural medicine or homeopathy .

thanks guys , well actually ,

that is more or less
that is more or less qar6 .5 k. i think that 's a bit low , but if they pay for your accom and schooling for your kids -LRB- your two biggest expenses -RRB- , you could be making some saving ... maybe just get them to specify the nature of the perks ; i.e. accom = flat or villa , transport = ? . also , do they provide you with return tickets per year for you and your family ? hope this helps .

the only way to determine if it 's a decent package is to try and assess your living costs and determine how much you would be able to save . that 's what the majority of people are in qatar for ... to save . it 's difficult to fix on a salary as there are so many extras -LRB- as others have mentioned -RRB- such as education allowance for kids , housing , transport , possibly a furnishing grant etc. .
prada , package is fine in
prada , package is fine in itself , it combines all major costs , hence you will be able to set aside little . but you will not be living like a king . if your salary back home is equal , stay away . if this is a major improvement ... why not .
thanks for the replies ...
thanks for the replies ... now we 're getting somewhere hehe . we 're a family of three . they will also cover schooling , which is great , since we have a 2 yr old . i think it 's okay , since they will cover all major costs . at the moment , we 're looking at saving about 2000qar . dh will also have to find a job once we are there . i have requested a detailed breakdown of all the extra 's they will be covering , so i 'm waiting to hear back from them . if they cover all major expenses -LRB- housing , schooling , transport , relocation , medical -RRB- ... 6400qar + dh 's salary are not to bad -LRB- i think -RRB- .
prada , do not come for less
prada , do not come for less than you are making in the us . the standard recruitment package for americans is your current salary plus 25 % overseas benefit plus housing , transportation , tickets , medical and schooling for up to three children . you 're being low-balled , honey , negotiate for more ! you wo n't have the chance later , believe me . mandi

mandi , originally ezdan was built as a hotel , then they re-built it as residential appartements . . i guess they left few smallest appartments without the kitchen as a hotel room . . the layout of the flats sucks -LRB- some flats built in a way that you have to cross the bedroom to get into the kitchen -RRB- , quality sucks , and it 's already feels old and stinky ... since they rent out some apartments for the short term like a hotel , you can imagine what 's going in the lobby every day ... people with the luggage , coming , leaving . . quite depressing place . i could recommend it as a temporary accommodation in the west bay for those who just came in qatar , has a workplace in west bay and is intending to look for the place to live at the same area . .

what do you mean official ? any reports are only guesswork . yes , some landlords are putting their rents up because there 's a demand on certain properties in the market . anything that 's popular and decent quality will probably see a year on year raise ... if you do n't like it , they just rent to the next person . on average though , there really should n't be a raise !

re : itinerary for malaysia tour
this was already discussed in few topic before . . use the search box on top right . malaysia is a very nice place to visit . its also safe & very good specially with your family . kuala lumpur is not very big , u can use monorail to go around places as other road transport may consume lot of time due to heavy traffic . do n't forget to visit the genting highlands & test a cable car above 200 million years old forest . :-RRB- kuala lumpur menara , aquaria , klcc , petronas , bird 's park are some places you will find very interesting .

re : itinerary for malaysia tour
why you want to visit for 7 days only ? try for minimum 2 weeks consideraing air ticket expense . i will suggest you following interary . day 1 : travel from doha to kulalampur , take connecting flight from kl to langkawi . stay langkawi for atleast 3 days . it is beautiful island . day 4 : travel from langkawi to penang . stay in penang for 3 days . there are so many places to visit near peneng . you can take car rental for visit all places or city bus tour . dont forget to visit kek lock temple day 8 : travel from penang to kulalampur . dont go to kulalampur city . after landing in kl go straight to genting high land . children will enjoy there stay there for 3 days . day 12 : come back to kulalampur stay 3-4 days in kl vivit all places & do shopping , take flight to doha

whats the right age to start solid or semi solids for a infant ??
mums please suggest ... ... .
re : whats the right age to start solid or semi solids for ...
it varies no 2 babies are alike . you need to ask your doctor and trust your instincts as a mother .
re : whats the right age to start solid or semi solids for ...
dear lauraferns , i 'd suggest you to watch your baby 's growth closely and at some time around 4-6 months , you may notice that your baby is not getting enough from your milk . -LRB- this is purely subjective but you are the best person to make the decision -RRB- . at this stage , you can start a little -LRB- spoonfuls -RRB- of rice water , egg yolk , a few squirts of orange juice etc. . , in the beginning and if you find that everything is going well , then you can introduce some more new items - one a week or so . gradually you will find that your baby is enjoying all these new foods . remember to keep up with the breast milk as long as possible along with these weaning foods . if you would like to include cereal , you could do that too . by 1 year of age the infant should have had a taste of everything you ever want him/her to . i would advise you not to add sugar or salt additionally in any food item because you may be introducing an unwanted habit for life . good luck with the weaning . ap
re : whats the right age to start solid or semi solids for ...
no 2 babies are alike.check with your doctor . i started semi solid for my kid after 6 months and solids after a year . .
re : whats the right age to start solid or semi solids for ...
from what i 've been told and have read ... it 's best to wait until six months for most babies -LRB- always check with the baby 's doctor -RRB- . this is a great website that i used often for food recommendations for babies : http://www.wholesomebabyfood.com/ they also have great information on what foods to avoid until the baby is older . good eating to you baby !
re : whats the right age to start solid or semi solids for ...
best age to introduce semi solids is when the baby is 6 months old . do not introduce salt and sugar to baby 's meals untill he / she is 1 year .

is there anyway around noc ?
is there anyway to avoid the requirement of a noc if you want to change a job and your employer does not want to give you a noc ?
re : is there anyway around noc ?
for what i have read in the site , yes there is a way . since your current sponsor/employer does not want to give release/noc then move back to your country , wait for 2 years and then come back . sorry but if you can not get noc then the most likely situation is for you to go back home . regards !!
re : is there anyway around noc ?
if they did n't give you a noc the only way is to go back . . but when your old company and the new company have same sponsor , then the new company can ask for the noc and hire you and you dont have to wait for 2 years !
re : is there anyway around noc ?
this may be - if your employer dont have work and not giving you salary human right commission helps some times , but dont ask me where are they ?

petrol stations on way to uae

ok here is my advice . fill in
ok here is my advice . fill in qatar before you leave then fill up again just when you are leaving the saudi boarder , this will be the saudi side before the uae boarder . this should be enough for to get to abu dhabi or even dubai . because if you miss this petrol station then the next station within in uae is atleast 100km . this is from my experience of 2007 , i dont know if they have built any more petrol station since then . also a small factor to consider is that petrol in qatar and saudi is cheaper than uae . have a safe trip .
there are many petrol

there is a petrol station less than a kilometer after going thru the saudi border from qatar -LRB- right side -RRB- . there is another one a few kilometers before exiting saudi to the uae -LRB- left side -RRB- . there is a petrol station a few kilometers after passing thru the uae border -LRB- right side -RRB- . this is the last petrol station along the highway before reaching abu dhabi proper . keep in mind the petrol price in uae is 3x compared to saudi . i hope this helps . have safe trip .

re : is police clearance required for all transfers of ...
a police clearance certificate -LRB- pcc -RRB- from your country of citizenship is mandatory during sponsorship transfer . at the indian embassy , the pcc -LRB- for indian nationals -RRB- will be issued within 2 days . need to fill up the form and 2 photos and around 80 qr . this pcc then needs to be stamped at the ministry of consulate affairs -LRB- this is the same mofa but they 've shifted and renamed this section , the building is on your right when traveling from munthaza signal -LRB- radwat khalil intersection -RRB- to gulf cinema signals . this document then needs to be submitted to your new sponsor , they will get a medical date for you -LRB- yes , it needs to be done , even if you 've done it before for the previous employer -RRB- . when the medical result and pcc is submitted to the cid , you 'll go for fingerprinting and then in 2 weeks cid will either approve or deny the sponsorship change . if the sponsorship change is approved , they will give you / your sponsor your qatar pcc . end of procedure . enjoy new job : - -RRB-

we reached cornish at 6 pm . nothing except huge crowed . they put 3 tv and there was nothing to show . all the time showing sea , some dead man , old houses , fire etc. at least they should have broadcasted morning event or some dignitaries meeting and wishing other dignitaries . only entertainment was that an old gentle man was asked by police to move away from some area as it was for the family but that man refused to move and there was long argument . the man flatly refused stating that where it is written reserved for the family '' he also called 2 ladies and asked if they have any problem if he sits here . ladies told no , he then asked police that if ladies have no problem then what your problem is . you being a man , you should also move and keep lady police in family zone . the police man got fed up and left the place but police man was good and never lost tamper . realized that quarrel or argument can also be entertaining and good times pass . even some helicopter was flying ; every one was looking at that . overall it was not very exciting , just watching crowed and children . fire cracker show at 8 pm was fantastic . it was worth watching .

'' in fact , concentrations of fine particles , or carbon soot , skyrocket for up to 24 hours after the show , reaching levels as high as those from wildfires . also , traces of poisonous metals , which give fireworks their bright colors , and perchlorate , a hormone-altering substance used as an oxidizer , trickle to the ground , contaminating water sources . one environmental protection agency study found that perchlorate levels in an certain lake rose 1,000-fold after a fireworks display , and they stayed high in some areas for up to 80 days . yeah . that 's not really good at all . but because fireworks are so cool , we 're probably not going to stop using them anytime soon .

pitstop - apart from what
pitstop - apart from what all others said above try to venture outskirts of sydney . i have been to singleton , hunter valley , bowral etc. do a wine tasting tour in hunter valley with nice lunch on the wineyard itself . you can have all kind of meets . crocodiles , kangaroos etc. you can see the process of wine making . then proceed to singleton . what a nice community there . they are like a family . everybody knows each other . stay in a motor inn run as a family business . then proceed to bowral . home of sir donald bradman . this is the part of rich people live once they retired . what a nice place is that . it is like you are living a beautyful garden . all buil ; dings are like old england style . after 5.00 pm all the people gather in the englsh style pub for a beeer or two.everybody knows each other .

relax in the natural
relax in the natural paradise of noosa with a laidback vibe and no buildings higher than the trees , the sub-tropical paradise of noosa is a place where you can really relax . but that doesnt mean theres nothing to do here . noosa brings international resort glamour to its pristine beaches , national park and lush hinterland .
there are many great places
there are many great places around australia , sydney and the habour bridge , brisbane 's story bridge , the gold coast , melbourne 's yarra river , perths 's bell tower and northbridge night clubs , tasmainia 's mountians , broomes beaches , the list goes on

yeah
yes , i visited australia this year in april . it was fun there . i visited sydney and melbourne . in sydney , i visited opera house , sydney tower , sydney harbor , darling harbour , botanic gardens , blue mountains , three sisters and jenolan caves . all are must visit places . in melbourne , i visited great ocean road , 12 apostles , warnambool , ballarat , gippsland lakes , penguin island , yarra forests , melbourne city , crown casino . remember , i am talking about only one city and state victoria . . whole australia is a tourist place ... i could n't go to gold coast but insha allah next time i will go there first . people are very nice and cooperative , we did n't see any racism and rudeness stuff . regarding shopping , australia is little bit expensive but dfos are reasonable . now a days there will be winter over there . sydney has pleasant weather but there are four seasons in a day at melbourne . winds are very chilled in melbourne . if you find time , travel between sydney to melbourne or vice versa by road . i missed it but i heard it is fun . have a nice trip !!! if there is any further information needed , let me know .
in sydney
in sydney shopping malls closed at 5 pm , been there with my kids so were given priority on the tourist places we visit , thats the only good thing travelling with kids you dont have to q.
najamss ,
thank you so very much . very useful information and i will list it all for reference . : -RRB-
wild life ...
ooh i forgot to mention ... visit sydney aquarium and wildlife at darling harbour also . these both are in melbourne as well . you will be surprised to see australi 's wild life ... i have also forgot to mention sovereign hills -LRB- old gold field -RRB- , there is live museum or it is called theme park . they have setup the a city of 1850s and all people are working there in old costume , it is fantastic place i hav ever seen ... and yes make your mission that u have to see kangroos and koalas live on roads and trees . in case of koalas , i touched it and spend some time with koalas in sydney wild life but i had decided that i will see kangroos live on roads or in jungles ... and atlast i have seen them in gipsland ... omg they were huge ... . if someone ask from me which one was the best place , i will say , `` i am in love with great ocean road '' ... .

your phone should have come
your phone should have come with a disk to install on your computer . there should be several phone shops out there that carry or sell the usb cable to connect your phone to your pc . you can also use bluetooth to connect your phone to your pc but no matter what you are going to have to have the software to do it . hope that helps . you need w800i software usb cable or bluetooth device for your pc or laptop after that backing up should n't be an issue . ______________________________________________ brazilian jujitsu in qatar http://iloveqatar.net/bjj/

excess baggage ?
looking on a couple of other threads and having read a couple of blogs , tell me if i should pack in my excess baggage : canned pumpkin chocolate chips pie pan and in household goods : -LRB- not sure if they will ship food -RRB- diet root beer ziplock bags book supply curious about : cookbooks -LRB- though seriously i can get anything from the internet , still , you got your tried/trues ... -RRB- is it hard to find us measure cookbooks ?
look man . . the easiest way
look man . . the easiest way to satisfy yourself is to call airport or cargo department ... i 'm sure they will satisfy you !! cheers
shellyjean
ziplock bags , chocolate chips and pie pans you can get here in almost all the shops -LRB- definitely shoprite & megamart -RRB- . canned pumpkin - sorry do n't eat it but they seem to sell every other kind of canned product here ! cookbooks and books - loads of places to buy books here so do n't worry . a lot of people organise book swaps and the best place to buy them are all the table top sales ! diet root beer - ca n't help you on that one but shoprite seem to sell a lot of american brand drinks but they are quite pricey . i would be really careful bringing them over though in case they leak etc. www.qaws.org
canned pumpkin is sometimes
canned pumpkin is sometimes available at megamart , but if you want some for this thanksgiving then i would bring it with you just to be sure . i did bring a heap of ziplocs with me from the u.s. they 're pricey here and i have only found the good freezer bags at megamart for $ $ $ . seriously , i went to costco and purchased a couple of packs of the gallon and a couple of the quart . have n't regretted it yet ... but ... i also had a 40 ' container and almost no furniture so it was a no-brainer for me . you can get chocolate chips here , but in the event that you 're a chocolate connoisseur do n't count on the good stuff . the waxy-tasting nestle is about as good as you 'll get for chocolate chips .
choc chips
best place for baking stuff -LRB- including chocolate chips -RRB- is shoprite - they have hersheys choc chips :d ... one for me ... one for the cookie dough ... giant stores do cheap freezer bags of every size imaginable but they 're not the zip ones they 're just the press shut ones . . www.qaws.org
i 'm bringing the splenda
i 'm bringing the splenda cause we just stocked up at costco before we got the interview . that stuff is expensive and very lightweight :-RRB- i appreciate the syrup suggestion and all the others . how bout coffee ? do they have foldgers -LRB- husband 's fave -RRB- . he is getting weird about the idea of not getting his -LRB- exactly the same every day lunch -RRB- preferred foods .
diet root beer is sold at
diet root beer is sold at megamart and various stores , i can hook you up lol it 's a & w brand
hi there , definately bring
hi there , definately bring out the splenda cause it cost a bunch here ... i actually have a friend of mine bring it out for me each time she comes from the states ... all the other stuff you will get here - might be a bit pricier than what you would pay there but hey - as long as you can get it . the root beer am not to sure about ...
fresh ? i find very little
fresh ? i find very little of our produce to fall under the category of what i would call `` fresh '' ;-RRB- yes , bring some canned pumpkin just in case megamart runs out . you can find regular ol' ziplocs or generic ziploc-types . . . but the freezer bags that really hold up are not readily available unless you pay $ $ at megamart . -LRB- that said , i have n't tried shoprite . -RRB-
i 've been able to get canned pumpkin
all 5 thanksgivings i have had here . just do n't wait until the last minute and you 'll be fine . i still have 3 cans from last year in fact . i can buy freezer bags practically anywhere . decent choc chips come and go . just stock up when they are here and put them in your freezer . i do buy cookbooks in the us each summer , only have found british ones here -LRB- besides the us current best sellers -- which are expensive ! -RRB- diet root beer can also be found -- sometimes . i tried to find a pie pan all last year and know they never had a proper one at the grocery stores . i bought a new pie pan in the us this summer . my advice : do n't bring food . my employer did n't allow it anyway , and most do n't .
at the end of the day you
at the end of the day you get use to stocking up on what you like when you find it here , and if you ca n't then learn to substitute or do without . i stopped bringing food back years ago . our bed mattress was the best thing we brought over . ca n't find the quality here .
do n't stress about the pie
do n't stress about the pie pan , i bought three of them and we 'll be going to sri lanka for thanksgiving - it 's the same as second eid -LRB- al adha . -RRB- mandi
mandi , better stock up on
mandi , better stock up on cranberry sauce too !!! we 'll take it all mwa ha ha ah . splenda is available here in the diabetic sections of most grocery stores - i would n't bother bringing it with you sj . signature line > `` you ca n't fix stupid ''

all 365 days are peak period for job seekers in qatar . there are hundreds looking for job openings with in doha , some of them are lucky to get at 1st attempt and many are desparate even after 2-3 months . again it all depends on the profession and compromises for having landed here with out a job on hand . some say '' trial costs nothing '' but here trail costs a lot to find a job . still best of luck , try online vacancy 's and apply .
should the landlord also be living in the flat he is subletting to others ?
i am renting a room in a shared 4 bedroom flat . the person who signed the contract for the flat does not live with us -LRB- only comes at month end to collect rent payments -RRB- . is this legal in qatar rent law ?
re : should the landlord also be living in the flat he is ...
almost all rent contracts include a no-subletting clause ... so he wo n't be able to do it .
re : should the landlord also be living in the flat he is ...
bleu ; most properties are actual sublets by agents , if you read my answer again , you will understand what i am talking about , as long as the sublet is done legally meaning with a contract between the agent/landlord and the tennant it is legal . subletting does n't only mean renting out a property that was rented from an agent without a contract . these are facts .

how can i apply canadian visit visa from qatar
how can i apply a canadian visit visa from qatar , advice me please
re : how can i apply canadian visit visa from qatar
you need an invitation letter from a sponsor in canada . that person should be earning a stipulated amount of salary . you should have enough financial transactions in your account for a period of minimum 1 year . you should provide them with proof as to why you will return back to the country like you are having a job here or you are studying here ... then go to the high commission .

ive never heard about any

you 'd be less likely to notice even if they did , as most of the sites you access from north america are in north america . i expect you 'll find local sites are loading at usual speed -LRB- try www.gulf-times.com , for example -RRB- . it 's the overseas ones that are slow -LRB- like ql -RRB- .
i doubt many websites are
i doubt many websites are actually hosted in qatar , or the middle east . most will be in the us .
actually it seems gulf times

who is hosted in qatar ?
does anyone know a company that hosts its website in qatar ? i 've found two : http://www.qatar.net.qa/ - qtel http://www.moi.gov.qa/ - ministry of interior most of the top-10 local sites -LRB- nine , probably -RRB- are hosted in usa . any others in qatar ?
dracula
ql used to host with mediatemple , which is based on virtualized servers , but when the traffic took off they switched to <a href="http://rimuhosting.com/"> rimuhosting </a> . there are now two data centres in doha . one run by qtel , the other by meeza , which is part of qf . i just do n't know the reason why any non-governmental website would host in either of them . i know that before ql switched to rimuhosting , they were paying $ 100 a month for hosting . now , i 'm sure they 're paying more , but not huge amounts more . both qtel and meeza are never going to be able to compete on price . nor are they going to be able to compete on support . ql is number-three in the top-10 websites in qatar , and it runs on free software . <a href="http://www.qatarliving.com/user/kutch"> kutch </a> does a great job of running the local free-software group , but there just are n't the numbers of linux experts in qatar to be able to provide good support services . the other reason you might not want to host in qatar is the local legal framework . hosting in the usa is sometimes frustrating if you receive a barrage of dmca takedown notices , but at least the law is well-documented . here , you ca n't be sure that someone with a bit of wasta would n't make a phone call to qtel and shut you down . of course , there might be a technical reason to host here . if you needed low latency . maybe the data centres are full of companies ' file servers ? however , even if i was running an system that require a low ping , surely it 's a safer bet to host in dubai ? any examples of locally hosted websites ???

house rent increase
hello guys , can anyone help me find a copy of governing rules regarding house rent increase here in doha ? some says it should be 10 % maximum , but if a sharing accomodation asked an increase of 25 % , do you think it 's still legal ? how and where can a complaint regarding this unjust practices be made ?? thanks in advance : -RRB-
no governing rules will work
no governing rules will work here practically . if the landlord wants to increase the rent he can create any reason to send you out from his property . now no need to worry about the increse in rent . rent is coming down drastically . change the house
if you have a written
if you have a written contract with the owner , and this contract is signed on or after 01/01/2005 then he has no right to increase your rent up to 14/02/2010 as per the law . if the contract is signed before 01/01/2005 then an increase shall occur as per the following table : - rent amount less than qr 2000 >> > 20 % - rent amount between 2000-5000 >> > 15 % - rent amount between 5000-10000 >> 10 % - rent amount more than 10000 >> >> > 5 % in addition he can not kick u out unless you did not pay the monthly rent , or if you rent the flat to others , or if he want to use the appartment by him or his family mambers , or if he want to demolish the building and most of the above has to be through court evidence , , , also there is 6 months afetr you got the information in written before evacuation .

if you are living in al khor
if you are living in al khor a bike will be useful . we live in dukhan and my husband cycles everywhere . it is perfectly safe within the community but i really would n't go on the main roads . my husband bought a mountain bike here for 240qr , it 's not the best one but is still going strong 3 years on .
that 's a bit more
that 's a bit more positive ! thanks , it 'd be nice to have the option to get around . looking at the tour of qatar routes , there look to be some great 100k + loops out and around al khor . http://www.letour.fr/2009/tqa/course/docs/parcours.pdf
tucky ... bike is ok
from your post , i sense you 'll be quite depressed without your bike . a friend of mine shipped his from the us and now enjoys the -LRB- safe -RRB- daily rides as early as 05:00 am , to avoid sun strokes and heavy traffic . i agree with jasmine , you can ride where you live . also , you can engage in biking contests and events , held every now and then in doha . stay happy . salam
i 'm backimg jasmine !
if al khor is anything like dukhan , , you 'll miss your bike just to get around . i feel so lazy driving everywhere and i miss mine . biking in doha would be synonymous with ` death wish ' but otherwise , bring it . i 've yet to find a place with deals like you get in the uk -LRB- although i suppose it depends how much it costs to ship it -RRB- . i wish i 'd brought mine . i bought 2 for my kids over here and they 're pants .
hmm , in doha
can one bike around neighborhood areas ? we 'll be out in al duhail north , and though i do n't intend to allow my children to bike arab league st , i was hoping that i 'd be able to send them the 1k from our compound to the nearby park on `` unnamed '' -LRB- at least on google earth -RRB- streets . okay , or do n't even think it ?

how much is the penalty per day for not stamping the rp ?
my friend is already done in his medical and finger printing.his current sponsor is not yet processing his rp to be stamp in his passport.in his passport when he arrived here it says within seven days the bearer should process the rp . is it true that there 's a penalty ? how much per day ?
re : how much is the penalty per day for not stamping the rp ?
i think u get a minimum of 28 days , before a fine is imposed . . but then again , it depends on visa to visa ... !! is it a valid rp visa ... or a visiting visa ?
re : how much is the penalty per day for not stamping the rp ?
so 7 days is lax already ? is it already come back to 3 months ? thank you
re : how much is the penalty per day for not stamping the rp ?
in the passport it says that you should report to the expat office , if you have done the medical it 's ok , you still have 3 months to process your rp without penalty .

good day ! kindly help me with this . i have a sibling to come in doha as a tourist visa . is it possible to convert its tourist visa into visit visa . if so , what are the forms and requirement to secure ? also the procedure of application . thank you very much !
re : conversion of tourist visa to visit visa
no as per my knowledge tourist visa can not be converted into visit visa , i have tried this a year back , now if the regulations are changed i dontknow .
re : conversion of tourist visa to visit visa
i already applied for the tourist visa after i learned that there is no salary requirement for visit visa . then , wat is the best thing to do if after a month my sibling can not find a job ?
re : conversion of tourist visa to visit visa
if ur sibling comes on a tourist visa he can not be looking for a job . if he comes on a visit visa after a month you may apply for an extension for another 5 months . if he is lucky to get a job by then he will require to transfer to company visa -LRB- rp -RRB- if not he will have to exit and come back only after 3 months .

i 'm asking who can help me , because my wife she wanted to work , is she can work with husband visa or need to have any permit ? thanks ...
re : is anybody can help me ? my wife is under husband visa ...
as per the qatar immigration `` yes '' . she needs to obtain a work permit since she is dependent and not holding work permit . anyway it is for her employer to process for the work permit . also , many companies do not insist for the work permit for dependents .

re : bus service to bahrain
currently there is no bus services to bahrain , either you rent a bus and start this service . as far as i know saudi borders are on the way is a major restriction on the way to reach bahrain .
re : bus service to bahrain
not directly , but you can get the saptco bus from b ring near sana to al gosaibi hotel in al khobar , and from there get the saudi-bahrain transport bus , or a taxi over the bridge . the saptco office can probably give you more details .

re : how women should wear in qatar ???
covering one 's knees , bosom and shoulders is always a good idea .
re : how women should wear in qatar ???
to avoid unwanted attention from others , it is best for your wife to wear clothing that covers her knees and shoulders . also best to make sure no skin around the waist/hips is showing , and no cleavage !
re : how women should wear in qatar ???
a reminder from your brother . it is always good to wear the dress which god asked us to wear . it can be used every part of the world . so please please try to know what our `` creator the lord of heavens & earth '' asked us to do . and let us practice it . then no worries .

comfortable clothing that is not revealing .
re : how women should wear in qatar ???

crossing red and getting back
yeserday i crossed a red , was able to stop and reverse to the white line before the signal . any chance i will save the 6k riyals ? . didnt actually have the presence of mind to look out for the flash . i actually lost my concentration because an emergency vehicle with flashing lights on top veered to the `` left only '' lane and got back into the straight lane and i like a dumb bloke looked at him instead of looking at the signal
re : crossing red and getting back
that happened with me , they did not charge even the flash lighted . the cameras record vedio as well so they will see that you did not cross the light . regards .
re : crossing red and getting back
i heard there is video recording at signals so if they think you are good enough they might not charge you , but you can never say . incase it comes then try to talk with them asap and you might get lucky .
re : crossing red and getting back
hi thanks everyone in the few months that i have been here i found the driving to be very stressful - more than in saudi or bahrain where i lived before.the other day i saw a woman driving a lincoln suv as though trying to reach her house on fire . still wondering how such people can have a driving licence with such tough laws around . regards and a have a good day !

alcohol at the pearl
am i correct in thinking that none of the restaurants at the pearl are allowed to sell alchol anymore ?
oh my dayz ! when will you ppl
oh my dayz ! when will you ppl stop ranting and raving and crying to heavens above for the suspicion of booze in qatar ? this is totally ridiculous !! well just for the records , alcohol sales has been suspended only at the pearl ... that 's just one focking tiny area of the fockin city of doha aight ? . other outlets and hotels and still got it on their menu , besides if you just care to walk in to qdc im sure you can notice the availability of liquor at these stores . i 'm getting very pissed off about the situation here , in the sense that so many expats are just outraged that this one section of the city has had sales suspended !! so they run to ql to bit-ch about it , as tho if without alcohol , the world would crumbles tomorrow . !!! pffff give it a fockin rest . if you need booze that bad , you have a problem . ! and if living in another culture is so difficult because you may not be able to drink , then you might want to consider just going home to your comfort zone .

only suspended ...
yup ... alchohol was only ` suspended ' from sales on the pearl -LRB- not officially banned -RRB- . give them around 5 more months and it will return back to full alchohol sales . this ban reminds me of a 1998 ban on women smoking ` shisha ' -LRB- hookah pipes -RRB- . it was later lifted . its kind of qatars way to calm the religious left when they have an incident . i would of thought maybe a religious mans kid came back home drunk and filed a complaint or something ? just a guess .

an interesting article
http://m.arabianbusiness.com/qatar-alcohol-ban-could-be-tip-of-iceberg-for-gcc-440454.html qatars move to ban the sale of alcohol on its flagship pearl development may hint at the start of a gulf-wide clampdown on booze sales as governments look to pacify local fears , analysts said . the gcc states may move to rein in sales and tighten alcohol legislation in a bid to walk the line between the expatriate population and their muslim citizens in the wake of the arab spring unrest , said guy wilkinson , managing partner at dubai hospitality consultancy , viability . qatar is hardly the first gulf state in which the local population has expressed its concerns over the sale of alcohol , he told arabian business . following the arab spring , i expect muslim parties to have more and more influence over the control of alcohol throughout the region . the sale of alcohol is strictly monitored in five of the gulf states with saudi arabia operating an outright ban on the sale and consumption of liquor . the move to offer alcohol licenses to outlets and non-muslims is largely a nod to the regions expatriate workers , who vastly outnumber the local population . but the decision has been met with criticism from some citizens who oppose the sale of liquor in muslim countries . qatar retains comparatively tight rules governing alcohol consumption , said wilkinson . just a few years back , one could only find it in just a few luxury hotels and clubs with strict entry procedures , he said . the fact that its population has increased so fast over the last few years has evidently not changed the concerns of muslims over the potential ill effects of alcohol consumption , particularly in terms of moral behaviour . chiheb ben mahmoud , head of hotel advisory , for mena at jones lang lasalle , said the open sale of alcohol was always a delicate balance for gulf governments . sometimes , local public opinion is heated up on the back of a combination of factors . it is common for authorities in these cases to act swiftly in order to defuse tension and prevent the issue from heating up further and getting out of control , he said . the suspension of sales on the pearl could be seen as a wake-up call or a reminder of the invisible red lines not to be crossed .
many thinks it 's their rights ,
when it 's already a compromise between the host and the visitors . and surely , the noisy one will keep blah blah blah ! it 's just a choice between `` more money less booze or less money more booze '' ! lol ! in saudi , it 's `` more money and illegal booze '' , and the expats survive there !

the vin decodes the `` engine type '' . in the case of my car it identifies the engine type as : 4.7 l v8 sohc 16v if you change it to a v-6 engine , the code will be wrong !

honey , in general , combined with cinnamon helps with many kinds of diseases . i personally use this combo for clearer skin and to battle fatigue . this really boosts my energy level , so i exercise longer and it also decreases my appetite . i have also read that if honey is taken in the right dosage , it does not harm diabetic patients .

ask your friends here to get
ask your friends here to get tourist visit visa issued for you .
thanku
thanku for the help also wanted to ask where can i stay alone as i have heard i cant stay with guy friends , so where and how can i stay .
you want to get the visa
you want to get the visa yourself , you would need to contact qatar embassy in your country . no idea about the requirements though .
you can stay at my friends
house . she stays alone . but i 'll have to ascertain that you are safe .
first of all dear
we must know your nationality , secondly , your male friends never get a visit visa for you as only husband , father , brother or any blood relation can apply for a visit visa , qatar is a safe place if you have self confidence . you can not stay with male in a hotel or any apartment unless you prove that he is your brother , father or husband .
loads and loads of hotels
loads and loads of hotels here to stay ... and tons of flats , houses , villas are empty : -RRB-
better ask ur friend
u can get tourist visa by your own but it will cost you so much , so if you have friends here in doha ask them to get visa for you from some agency such as cleaopatra or fahad . regarding job issue you can get job easily in doha and that depend on your experience but you have one strong point with you and that is you are fm and it easy for fm to get job here in doha . for accomodation you can ask your friend to find bed space for you till you will not get job so in this way you will be not spending so much for your accomodation . doha is safe place for everyone comparing to another gcc countries , but still you have to be carefull from bad peoples and they are everywhere in all countries . good luck and hope you will enjoy in doha .

pitstop i dont think sth is wrong with japanese
as i mentioned above maybe i was expecting sth different . all i know about japanese culture was from movies . and if you do not try to make a lil search and try to know about a new culture - like me - , you can feel disappointment sometimes . for example i am feeling admire for japanese people because they are almost the leader of robotic technology , and for electronics they are also on the tops . but sometimes when i experience that it is very hard for some people to understand sth simple you are disappointed . in any case i admire japanese people because they could build a strong and developed country after such a massive destruction at wwii while keeping their own traditions . and if we return to our original theme i love sushi too . am glad that they are so good at it ; -RRB-

there are instances that you can get back within short span of time here in doha , stated in the law also , that when you are cleared and given eit visa you can not come bck to doha until 2 yrs but in cases , there are some companies giving to their employees whom dont have any trouble made or clean and neat in the workplace , no problems give to the company ; have given the visa exit clearances only and can come bakc any time since this is exit clearance not cancellation of working visa ; by the time you go home already the validity of your pataqa will be counted for ; if you have reached the expiration of your pataqa and did not come back as soon as possible then the company ca declare null & void and this will be worked out by the mandoob for automatic cancellation of your working visa ... .
fyi
in addition , it is also clear stated by the labor law of qatar that once you been cancelled , the working visa is still on working condition but the company whom you have worked for will give you re-entry visa for going back here and work with the same company otherwise automatic discharges of the working permt on the side of the company and no more excuses but you will get back after 2 yrs .

cancer patient
is there any charity or foundation here that maybe can help to a cancer patient ? or let 's just say i am a son of a cancer victim , who does n't know what to do if i 'm going home in pi to be with and to take care of my mom or still stay here in doha because i am the bread winner in the family and need to work so that i can send them their allowance ??? anyone can help me?any good samaritan ??
thanks for the reply
yes , it 's really been so hard for me to decide but i really need also to be with my mom , but the problem is i am the bread winner which makes me break my heart into pieces knowing that my mom is suffering from this kind of illness without me at her side .
thank you
what 's the name i am going to look to ?
done calling
they said that the patient should be here in doha so that they can make an actions . but unfortunately my mom ca n't travel anymore . = -LRB-
this is what im thinking ...
dear kasheem , if im in your situation i will go back to my back home.i know you are the bread winner.but since your mother cant travell and she cant come to doha.so you have to go.otherthan suffering.because every single minute you will feel you are living hell.and your mother also happy when you are her side.i know money is main problem.ask some help people around you.if i have money i will give you.but im jobless.so ask for help.may be you feel its stupid idea.but i will do same if i were you.asking money is difficult.but in this world most presious one is your mom.so go back.other than suffering .
mck28
thanks and your comments is really so true but my big problem is i do n't have money to use , and i do n't know where to ask . it 's really so bad that i cant do anything to go back home and be with my mom , my mom missing me a lot and i miss her also . it is already more than a year that i am here in doha and away from my mother . i love my mom so much because she is the only one who raised us , she is single parent my dad left us when i was just 5 years old . and i know how hard it is being single parent raising 3 kids . and now cant even do anything to be with her side . = -LRB-

is kia a good car
hello ql , is kia a good car . how about it parts , is it available anywhere . is it expensive how about the maintenance of this car . is worth it to buy this type of brand . im thinking of buying a rio . please help need advice
kia
kia is a good car , i am using a 2008 kia optima and it hasnt given me any trouble so far . all i had to change were the break pads battery , glass wiper and the headlight bulb which are very normal accesories to change in any car . the parts are very cheap . if i recollect i hardly spent less than 500 riyals for the break pads and the glass wiper . the parts are easily available at the kia service centre in industrial area . the pick up is good and the ac is excellent . you should consider buying a kia ,
do n't listen to us . . see what the experts say . .
http://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/kia_rio_2013
there is another con that can
there is another con that can be resolved with little or no skill . the cabin ac filters are too small and they easily get stacked with this dusty weather , usually my commute is from very short distances so in 2 years mine is just 13,000 kms meaning that i do n't do much service in it , one thing i learned is to replace the cabin ac filter kits for maximum efficiency . the kit would cost from 50 to 100 qar and it only takes 10 minutes to replace it .
btw , my first car in doha was
btw , my first car in doha was a 2007 kia sorento . i bought this car second hand from a british couple . we still have it and my wife is driving it . i 've done some offroad at the inland sea and let me tell you , i was shocked with the performance . our most recent trip was with two friends , both driving their lc prado -LRB- v6 version -RRB- and they could not believe what this sorento was capable of doing . kia is probably the most underrated brand . as i said , service is my main concern , other than that it 's great for the money .
what 's the warranty here ?
` cos kia give a 7 year warranty on new cars sold in uk . clearly they have faith in their reliability . i 've driven a kia sportage and it 's ok . good value for money .
how about hyundai
thank ql for giving me these comments and suggestion . how about hyundai . i think kia and hyundai are now seperate company . any comments on this brand and how they perform on the road . is it cheaper than kia ? how about it maitenance and parts cost ?
kia is a good car ...
kia is a good car ... sportage is quite good ... but not the latest model : -LRB-
favoritetrick , hyundai is
favoritetrick , hyundai is also pretty good - can not comment on their service since it 's run by a different group in qatar . be aware that kia and hyundai are very similar in specs and spare parts . i 've seen many spare part boxes branded as kia/hyundai .
its a nice enough car but
its a nice enough car but underpowered particularly in low gears as you start to accelerate - youve really got to `` floor it '' .
you have to visit kia sr to
you have to visit kia sr to obtain more information or check the review of the car to http://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/kia_rio_2012 for more info please send your queries to jesnetkia@gmail.com or 55107890
parts and maintenance is
parts and maintenance is cheap but performance is cheap too . . better to buy a toyota coz the kia rates are close to toyota too in some models .
thank you very much for this
thank you very much for this information . i guess i have to think twice before buying this rio because i red negative review about this car and just want to know from those who have the experienced using this
dont make a silly mistake , go
dont make a silly mistake , go for nissan tiida
kia rio
i have a kio rio hatchback since 2005 and absolutely maintenance free so far.yes the pickup is slow but its a pleasure driving it . go for it .
kia overall has the best
kia overall has the best prices on the market , compared to most brands in qatar . their quality is comparable to these ` top ' japanese brands like toyota , honda or nissan . now , chairboy has brought a valid point - the kia rio version that is being sold in qatar is a little bit underpowered . i own a 2010 rio and besides this , i have no complains about the car . i just i could own a manual version but for security reasons is always better to have automatic shift so other members of the family could drive it . the pluses are : price and quality and the newer models are much nicer and better looking than its predecessors . the big no ! particularly in qatar : the quality of service . unfortunately they only have one service center in this country , which is located in the industrial area . in many cases they could take up to two days just for an oil change ... last time the car was seldom washed and they did not vacuum it inside . there is a big rumour that they will be opening a new service center near the old airport area , unless this is true i would not consider buying a new kia but if they do , i would give it a go .
they 're similar - the last
they 're similar - the last time i surveyed , kia was slightly lower . just to give you an idea : rio = accent elantra = optima sportage = tucson sorento = santa fe etc. . . etc. . .
the best thing you to do is
the best thing you to do is to visit all your prospect brand , do a test drive and so on ... kia rio -LRB- accent , aveo , sunny , yaris , honda city , lancer -RRB- here in qatar kia they are giving 5 yrs warranty or 100000 kms . cheers !!

i came as a business visa shall i need exit permit
re : i came as a business visa shall i need exit permit
i think only if your business visa was extended past the initial 30 days .
re : i came as a business visa shall i need exit permit
wot ever the visa u com for , once to enter qatar and if u want to go out u need khurooj -LRB- exit permit -RRB- u can take it online with ur sponsors authority .
re : i came as a business visa shall i need exit permit
yes . exit permit is required if you stayed more than 15 days inside qatar .
re : i came as a business visa shall i need exit permit
you do not require exit permit once you come into the country on business visa . please , for all those who have answered to this question , you need to do your homework . i work in the hr and this is one of my core jobs to arrange visas for incoming candidates for the past 2.5 years .
re : i came as a business visa shall i need exit permit
dear carpediem , i guess your employer will kick your a ** soon . if business visa is extended for more than 30days in qatar then you must obtain an exit permit to leave the country .

my yahoo messenger has been blocked in the iphone 4s wht to do ?
when am trying to open the yahoo messenger in the iphone it shows only the keypad and black screen even when i tried to open my yahoo id in computer it says ure id has been blocked so i used my secret question to open it . after i checked again the messenger on the phone but same prblm black screen and keypad only . . any idea wht shall i do ? thanks in advance .
re : my yahoo messenger has been blocked in the iphone 4s ...
reactivate your yahoo ! account yahoo maintains its account disabled for 90 days before the reality of spending and eliminate it . therefore , if you change your mind within 90 days , you can get your account back as it was when asked to terminate your yahoo account . the revival is quite simple . you do not have to go looking for a page or a link to it . simply enter your yahoo account on any page and you can start . re-activate yahoo account - sign in to yahoo the same old code looks strange image will reappear and have to enter it . look carefully youre likely to make a mistake if they do , and then click next . re-activate yahoo account - click re-activate on this page you will see a small message is quite simple not always possible to retrieve data from your yahoo mail account . therefore , keep your fingers crossed and click re-activate . re-activate yahoo account - the final page this is the final page . if you are seeing this , then your account is not outside the yahoo system and will be in service within 24 hours . however , if you do not receive this message , you may want to register again or contact yahoo .
re : my yahoo messenger has been blocked in the iphone 4s ...
you do one thing just remove the yahoo messanger app and reinstall that . may be some missing in the updating i had that problem before in my iphone i done like that then it was ok
starting up bussiness in qatar
hi i have a few questions , we have a company already set up outside qatar and we want to open up a regional office in doha , whats the proceduers for such thing ? do we have to set up the company fully again in qatar ? do we need a local partner ? etc thanks aj
and also , what is the min
and also , what is the min investment capital i need to start up a company in qatar ?
hi aj , i work for a british
hi aj , i work for a british managed company that specializes in partnering with companies coming to qatar . the most common form of business setup in qatar is a limited liability company . to incorporate that company you 'll require ; - share capital of a qrs200 ,000 . - your qatari partner must have at least 51 % ownership . - the profit share of the partners does not have to match the shareholding of the partners . our company is in a position to act as your local partner . this is the basics , if you 'd like to know more , please feel free to pm me for more information . best regards , james
thanks for the info . i was
thanks for the info . i was just reading online about the new law that came out , it says that if your in the ict sector then you can actully own 100 % of the company is that true ? regards ,
ok , the answer to that is ,
ok , the answer to that is , yes and no ! it 's true this ` law ' was announced about 18 months ago . as with many things here , in reality it 's not quite as straight forward as it would seem . yes , theoretically an it company can be under 100 % foreign ownership , however , in practice it seems most of the companies involved are large international companies who have been ` invited ' to come to qatar by hrh . it 's an expensive route to take , and frankly there 's little chance of approval . we would be happy to go down this road on your behalf and make the application , though it wo n't be cheap with an extremely minimal chance of success ! any other info , let me know .

medical test for infant - required ?
medical test is required for infant to extend the visit visa ? people says like medical test is not required , but you need to pay the 100 qar in the medical commision for formalities , is that true ? why we need to pay 100 qar for no medical test for infant ? my kid is just 6 months old . let me know your valuable suggestion .
there is no medical test .
there is no medical test . but they will ask for a doctor 's statement giving the infant 's blood type -LRB- for the medical cards -RRB- and it 's also worth bringing immunization records .
infant need to go medical commission or not ?????
we need to take the infant to medical commission as well or i can go myself with all documents and pay the qar 100 ? other thing , blood group mention on immunization card -LRB- from pakistan -RRB- is ok or i have to take blood group report again from any laboratory from qatar ? thank you .
no blood test is required for
no blood test is required for child upto age of 16yrs . no need to take your child to medical commision.qr 100 is fees for stamping by medical comission on your documents.mother of the child must be needing medical tests.better give child 's paper with her while sending her in female section as work will get faster there . original visa alongwith copy mentioning your mobile no. , original passport + copy , pp photo , sponser 's -LRB- father -RRB- rp-these are required.nothing else !

transferring visa after the expiry
is it possible to transfer qatari visa to another sponcor after the expiry ? i know that it is leagal to stay in the country for 90 days after the expiry of visa , but will i have problems transferring visa to another sponcor after it expires ?
re : transferring visa after the expiry
your residence permit is expired . it means you do not have any residence permit . the grace period is given to finalize your matters in qatar in case you did n't have enough time , and to leave the country . grace period does n't mean you have a valid rp . and since you do not have an rp , what the he 'll are you going to transfer ? you have to renew your rp with your current sponsor , after that you can transfer your rp .
re : transferring visa after the expiry
. . and how many days can one stay if the visa is cancelled .
re : transferring visa after the expiry
i think if your sponsor give you noc then you have to pay the palenty of qr 200 per day and you can proceed , but it is better that you should consult some legel advisor ,
re : transferring visa after the expiry
the question is : how legal is to do the new visa with a new company after the expiry of the present visa without leaving qatar ? my present sponsor 's agreed to give me noc . he is frightning me that immigration will not do the new visa for me as the old one wil be expired .
re : transferring visa after the expiry
if you have submitted your case for sponsorship changing before expiry and when your case of changing is in processing and your visa expire then it is okand you have to pay only fine.i think fine is qr 200

thank you moma , do you recommend any specific location in switzerland ?
re : europe destination for this july ?
try centreparcs . they are perfect for a family vacation and have `` villages '' in several european countries . my husband and son had a great time at centreparcs `` bispinger heide '' in germany . http://www.centerparcs.com/en/gb/home
re : europe destination for this july ?
hi , you could try the lake district in the uk , i have found the best places are coniston , kendal and windermere . i used to go with my wife and kids at least three times a year . weather should be ok that time of year , and it is fantastic for walks , and very safe for children . if you hired a car you could drive round the different villages and stay in a different b & b or guest house every night if you wanted , so there would be plenty of variety .
re : europe destination for this july ?
go to austria . it is slightly cheaper than the rest of europe . it has a beautiful landscape and has loads of historic architecture . the vienna zoo is one of the best zoos in the world . also , their museums of arts , natural history and science are amazing .

re : touched my car
ok . . thnx for ur explanation . . i ca n't help u buddy , sorry . .
re : touched my car
soniyaji , it is prevailing traffic rules in qatar , if it is slightly scratched or damaged while reversing , parking etc. , still it is better to go to traffic and show them , get a clearance paper , then go to insurance with their specified garages to get it repaired . there by you are safe at the time of istimara passing your car annually .
re : touched my car
with out a police report , garage guys will not agree to repair ur car . u need to go to ploce station & should pay 112 riyals to get the letter .
re : touched my car
if a car damages , no matter it is your own fault or by someone else 's ... a police report is a must in either case it 's a rule here .

renting property
hi , what is the standard fees / commission charged by real estates to find you a property ? whats the best and cheapest way to find an accommodation ? thanks
re : renting property
thanks ! non you have managed to give a decent answer ...
re : renting property
commission depends ; if you are paying already enough rent the agents cover it from landlord side otherwise 15day rent for them is enough , . the best way is to set your priorities/budget , area and alternate choices and then roam around looking for banners `` for rent '' , plus check daily ads in news papers , online ads , ask for references in your family/friends . . i believe over 60 % accomodation are not properly advertised and just street search , word of mouth and building caretakers support normally get you a nice apartment of your choice my 2 cents good luck

baby name ...
good morning qlers ... i am 6 months pregnant and im gon na give birth soon . my husband and i still cant decide what name will we give our angel , we had so many names in mind but whenever we try to put a name we end up fighting ... i need some of your suggestions ... regarding the best name i can give my baby . . thank you in advance . happy holidays too ... best regards , abbie
try suri
that tom cruise daughters name . . the los angeles times summarized the written statement cruise released on the birth as saying the name `` is a word with origins in both hebrew and persian . in hebrew , it means ` princess ' and in persian , ` red rose , ' it was claimed in the release . '' -LSB- 19 -RSB- however , magazines and blogs noted on cruise 's mistranslation on suri 's hebrew meaning . -LSB- 20 -RSB- in hebrew , suri actually means `` from syria '' , not `` princess '' . -LSB- 21 -RSB- -LSB- 22 -RSB- the wrong etymology might stem from the fact that suri is a yiddish pet form of sarah , which means `` princess '' . -LSB- 23 -RSB- curiously , in japanese ` suri ' can mean `` pickpocket . '' -LSB- 24 -RSB- in korean , ` suri ' is a conjugation of the verb ` to repair ' -LRB- mechanical devices -RRB- .
baby name
both you and your husband each come up with 5 girl names and 5 boy names . that 's if you do n't know the gender yet . i suggest names with family/cultural meaning . then each of you get to strike 2 girl/boy names off of each other lists -- no explanations . then try to whittle it down from there . use compromise . for my 2nd son , my husband picked out a name right off the bat . i thought it was so so , but 9 months later i had n't thought of any that i was crazy about and since my husband loved the name he picked out , i decided that it really must matter to him and so we went with the name he liked . this should be a fun experience !

baby name
another comment -- why worry about it so much yet ? for all of my 5 children we went to the hospital with a list of names , then when the child was born and we met him/her and discovered their personality , we went with the name that seemed to fit them best . sometimes just seeing your baby will help you to instantly decide what their name should be . it 's almost as if they tell you themselves what they want to be named .

re : should traffic violations be settled before ...

yes , else you will be barred from leaving the country
re : should traffic violations be settled before ...
i always settled traffic violations during registration and never had problem leaving country being frequent flyer ... how ?
re : should traffic violations be settled before ...
you will only have to pay the violations before travelling if the fines are registered to your qatar id . so for a speeding fine that a radar caught you doing will be registered to the vehicle and not your id in which case you will be fine . if you got stopped at a roundabout for not wearing a seatbelt and the police man asked for your license , then the fine would regisetred against your id , in which case you would have to pay the fine before travelling .
re : should traffic violations be settled before ...
it is only mandatory if you resigned and leaving qatar for good ... but for frequent flyer not necessary .
re : should traffic violations be settled before ...
qatars department of traffic and patrol police has said motorists who have outstanding fines will not be allowed to leave the country once a new law comes into force this week , reported the peninsula . potential violators can access the ministry of interiors website from october 2 to check for any possible fines . meanwhile fines will increase at a rate of qr1 per day if they are not paid within 60 days . via : ameinfo

if your pc got infected by a torjan virus that means whatever anti virus your using right now just didnt do the job well , no software is going to be 100 % sure to remove the virus . why dont u want to format it ? if its about the files make back up copies on dvd 's or buy an external drive . my advice is that a pc needs a good formatting atleast after 6 months , gets rid of all the junk that gets collected and runs must better : -RRB-

its depends . how severely your computer has been infected ? try to remove first by trojan remover v6 .7 . probably your anti-virus will wont work . after you slightly remove by trv6 .7 try installing kaspersky . it is the best in the market now . unless you need a clean format to your pc .
re : best way to remove trojan virus from pc ?
trojan remover is not that good enough . . download latest version of combofix , disable your antivirus software and run this one after scanning turn on you antivirus update it and run a deep scan . . then run a disk clean-up and registry scanner . . last thing keep away from p _ r _ o sites lols . . hope it helps
why is islam discussed the most ?
i may be wrong , but of all the religions or lack of , why is islam the most discussed religion on ql , and others are meerly referred to in comparrison during debates ? if so , why is it that islam is the most argued religon here ?
it 's those who do n't have
it 's those who do n't have sex who talk about it all the time .

thats right thejam , it looks alien to us as far as christianity is concern , comparitabily
when do you say that an islam nitpick is a nitpick , britexpat ?
when one becomes narrow-minded and they easily got offended with it . sometimes the illogical part of the religious faith -LRB- which seems to not adapt with the modern times -RRB- tends to rise up as being legit and plenty of people who stays in a country bounded by that certain religion has no choice but to make it look respectable -LRB- there really is a difference between `` respect '' and `` making it look respectable '' -RRB- to keep their adaptive -LRB- ` corruptive ' is too direct a term -RRB- freedom in bay . my explanations also work on other religions . we used to ` nitpick ' the jewish -LRB- and even israel -RRB- on the other side of the continent for the matter . some nitpicks are not nitpicks , but a reflection of the reality -LRB- if i do n't see it everyday , i never would 've known the common obvious -RRB- ... and some people just ca n't accept that , hence they perceive it as a nitpick . `` everything in this book may be wrong .

thejam , well said lucid
thejam , well said lucid points , herein lies the confusion . pitstop , why do you think it should be banned , how else can you explain the religon to many who want to know or debate , besides is n't that a muslims duty to not shy from discussions regarding his/her deen , but to address and explain and debate ? qatarexplorer , you also made valid points . yes , some debaters obviously appear to pose as muslims yet clearly are pregiduce . do n't you think that perhaps the debaters you mentioned do n't actually hate islam ? people often attack and fear what they do n't understand , its humans psychology . i 'd like to believe that a great majority , regardless of their negative comments , are actually drawn to islam because there is something undoubtedly real and logical about this religon and they may actually be searching or yearning for answers . i only wish that some muslims would debate responsibly knowing that they are at that very moment representing islam in these peoples eyes and therefore bear the responsibility of tolerance , patients & respect when we are faced with not so civilised debates because aldeen al akhlaq -LRB- religon is manners -RRB- this reminds me of when the prophet mohammed pbuh was driven out of altayef with stones thrown at him because they refused his message , then god sent him the angels -LRB- of wind and mountains -RRB- and asked do you want vengence ? to this the prophet pbuh replied -LRB- i cant quote accurately but the general jist of the response was -RRB- ` they know not and perhaps one day good will come from this people '

can one get a driving liscence when he is on a visit visa ?
hello , i am here on a family visit visa that will expire in feb 2012 . can i apply for a driving liscense . i know how to drive but i do n't have any driving liscense . also tell me whether i need to goto driving school before appearing for driving test ?
re : can one get a driving liscence when he is on a visit ...
<p> yes . you can apply for the licence . however the validity of your licence will be expired along with your vist visa validity . </p>
re : can one get a driving liscence when he is on a visit ...
that is but obvious bijoy ... anyway two contradictory opinions , i guess i 'll have to goto muroor and ask myself , thanks for all the help though
re : can one get a driving liscence when he is on a visit ...
without a valid driving license from your home country you can not apply for a qatari driving license .

if i fail to use my exit visa - is there a penalty ?
i have an exit visa due to expire - if i cant travel is there a penalty ?
re : if i fail to use my exit visa - is there a penalty ?
exit permit is valid for 1 week from issuance . .
re : if i fail to use my exit visa - is there a penalty ?
there are two types of exit permit . the type good for one use , which expires if not used and and unlimited exit permit which is good for one year . you should ask for the unlimited kind , if your sponsor is amenable , which will avoid the hassle of having to get one each time you leave the country -LRB- there is also a fee charged for the unlimited type -RRB- , but do n't be surprised if your sponsor refuses . there is no penalty for failing to use either type of exit permit .
re : if i fail to use my exit visa - is there a penalty ?
definatley not a problem , but a very good question that may answer a lot of people that maybe in the same situation in the future
re : if i fail to use my exit visa - is there a penalty ?
a follow up question ... is it possible to get again ur exit permit from your sponsor or still valid ? how many days do exit permit valid ?
visa on arrival in dubai airport .
hi there , i would like know for senior supervisor position on my visa - can i get a visa on arrival at dubai airport for my self and family . thanks !
how about doing some research and some reading on the internet
http://www.emirates.com/english/plan_book/essential_information/visa_passport_information/uae_visas.aspx sometimes public forums do not portrait a direct and straight forward answer but instead each and everyone 's experience . try contacting either emirates or etihad and ask them . your last resource would be approaching the uae embassy 's consular service and ask for guidelines . regards !!
yes
yes you can , but you have to pay for insurance with emirates nbd counter on dxb before proceeding to immigration counter , they will give you 30 days for you but no idea about your family !!!
thx
thanks galloper and syria man - for your quick response
as posted by galloper check
as posted by galloper check with the airlines as they will be the one allowing you to board the flight . if they dont allow you to board how will you reach the counter in dubai .
please call airline in which
please call airline in which you are flyin
you inquire via email through
you inquire via email through amer@dnrd.ae . send them a scanned copy of your qatar id and they will tell you if you are eligible for visa on arrival . sometimes the airlines will tell you that your occupation is not under the list and they might ask you to sign a waiver that if you are not allowed in to dubai you will have to shoulder your return and penalty .

how much would a family of 4 people spend in qatar just for food , clothes and entertainment ?? thanks
re : how much would a family of 4 people spend in qatar ...
it depends on what type of cloths and entertainment you want . for entertainment there is not much to do besides going to the shopping malls or restaurants . you will find everything , from very high end clothing -LRB- gucci , d & g , etc. -RRB- to gap , banana republic and department stores . no deals like outlet malls in the us . regarding restaurants , depend where you want to dine : ritz carlton , four seasons , tgi fridays , etc. . expect prices to be the same to , for example , boston .

re : how to obtain a visit visa ?
www.moi.gov.qa
re : how to obtain a visit visa ?
do you have a relative here in qatar ? if you do n't have , then you can not apply for a visit visa because visit visa is only applicable if you have relative working or living in qatar . the best you can do is to apply for a tourist visa thru travel agency or qatar airways . you can also apply in any hotel here in qatar thru their website ...
re : how to obtain a visit visa ?
check with qatar embassy there . if you know someone in qatar , please ask them to arrange
re : how to obtain a visit visa ?
visit visa need to be sponsered by resident of qatar . if you have any one to sponser , you may get it . otherwise you need to apply as a tourist in qatar . if you work in uae as a professional like doctor/engineer/auditor or other professional you may get entry visa in airport . please check it in qatar embassy in uae . wish you a happy time in qatar ... most welcome ...

foreign ministry attestation
i went foreign ministry today for an attestation of a character certificate which is issued from bangladesh embassy . they said they do not attest that kind of certificate anymore and i have to bring police certificate from bangladesh attested by foreign ministry there . is the rule has been changed or they just dont like my face : -RRB-
re : foreign ministry attestation
oh its badly !
re : foreign ministry attestation
yes , they have recently changed the rule . pcc from the country of orgin is only accepted the new rule is a big blow to the job aspirants
re : foreign ministry attestation
yes , they change rule & they changes very frequently , any certificate must be attested by home country 's ministry of forein affairs & embassy in doha , only then they attest ...
re : foreign ministry attestation
they themselves are not sure what they are doing . there are rumors that some of the certificates issued from the bd embassy are being accepted though they have not informed the embassy that they will not accept the certificates issued by the embassy . i think it 'll take some time for them to come out of their confusion .
re : foreign ministry attestation
it is changed or amended . amendments require when and as necessary . even in sea & air port too . now most of the airlines does not allow or encourage to carry liquid substances in flight after liquid bomb threat . law enforcement authorities are their to protect us by amending existing / old laws . v need to understand the situation & work accordingly.some times v ask the authorities to amend the existing law , when v fall in trouble.if u read daily news papers or the ministry sites , u would have saved ur time going there . cheers guys & b happy

rays reef at royal plaza , al saad street . great venue . they have soft play area for little ones , a larger soft play area with huge slides and climbing for older ones . a ball pool shooting area , , ball pool , video games and an area for arts and crafts and painting and stuff like that . i think they charge 40qr for each child but that includes a meal for each child aswell . plus they have underground parking and the staff take good care of the kids so you might be able to relax too ! ha , ha .

do we buy a wii before we move to doha frm uk
we are moving from the uk and have promised the kids a new wii when we move , are we best off buying it and the games in the uk or can we get it all easily in doha ? thanks for your answers .
wii
it is available her all over the place . the rate for the basic wii is about qr1300 . - / 1400 . - . however the additional games are not really available.so compare prices and make up your mind . however do buy the additional games to the package there . aisha-taweela
wii + wii sports is 175 on
wii + wii sports is 175 on amazon . the price aisha quoted above works out at about 245 , so cheaper to buy the console in the uk and i expect cheaper to buy the games in the uk a well . -LRB- for example , playstation 3 games cost about 60 here , which is way more than in the uk . -RRB-
its available here but if
its available here but if you get cheaper from your foreign money , why not buy it there . you might blame yourself later on in doha if you find out its cheaper in uk .

how can i get a car loan
can any one help me to get a car loan ? i went to qnb they told me that they need 10000 riyals salary transfer to issue the car loan ? but for me my salary is below 10 if there is any private agency can give the car loan ?? if they give what is the procedure .
re : how can i get a car loan
i think the salary limit of doha bank to get the loan is qr . 7000 / - .
re : how can i get a car loan
try first finance its next to muntaza gas station .
re : how can i get a car loan
try with other banks , if you have above 5,000 salary it is not so difficult , you need to give them salary certificate from company only .
re : how can i get a car loan
it depends on your bank sometimes , if you have a qib account then go to al-jazeera ... i took my car from there without problems ... it took 10 days to finish it because they were not clear about what papers they need and kept asking for them 1 by 1 and of course you ca n't get those at one day ...
re : how can i get a car loan
try ibq . but again , your salary has to be transferred and the company you are working for has to be approved at the bank . then you should be eligible for the loan if you meet the loan requirements . otherwise , try finance institutions such as first finance , they might be able to finance you . regards , hamad
re : how can i get a car loan
hamad you work for ibq do n't you ?? try them though 4473000
re : how can i get a car loan
call 3450493-rahul he is into sales at cbq . try ur luck .
re : how can i get a car loan
try to contact qatar finance these guys provide best car loan with minimum paper work . the interest rate is almost same with other banks . <a href="http://www.badcreditcarpurchase.com"> bad credit car buying </a>

being a acupuncturist my advice is the blood pressure is a natural process and the heart maintains its pressure high or low as per the demand from other organs . be prayerful and pray lord for forgiveness . when the heart becomes peaceful the blood flow will become normal . there is point sp5 which needs to be activated provided you prayerful and submit to your self to god . forget about medicine nobody in this world can cure any disease except god . read this web site `` www.foolproofcure.net ''

where can i get plant seed of road side growing plant ?
i found in qatar many places on road side plantation is there , it seems good , in small size plant having lots of flowers , i wish to get that plant seed , where it is available . it is possible to buy here .
re : where can i get plant seed of road side growing plant ?
u can get seeds from ... from . . opz i forgot the name of that shop . well i ll tell u the location . . if u are coming from toyota signal to gulf cinema , from gulf cinema signal take left . . if u take left , first u can see that on ur right side . .
re : where can i get plant seed of road side growing plant ?
there are many plant shops at the central market behind the fish market
re : where can i get plant seed of road side growing plant ?
you 've probably left it too late for this year as it will soon be too hot for these plants . what i 'd suggest is when the plants naturally run to seed , pick a few seed heads and keep them till september , then sow the seeds in a good quality potting compost ready for next winter .
re : where can i get plant seed of road side growing plant ?
try a nursery which sells plants
re : where can i get plant seed of road side growing plant ?
petunia the one which is available in many color -LRB- purple , white , yellow , pink , red , mixed colors -RRB- doesnt easily come up when u sow the seeds instead its better to buy a fresh plant with flowers form any nursery ... garden nursery between gulf cinema and mall round abt is where i usually get plants from . marigold comes in three to four variations and they grow from seeds very well ... like wut baldrick said u cud try it in sep as it already getting hotter ... chrysanthemums also u can find in roundabats and flower in bunches like the above two , plant is better tahn trying from seeds . as far as seed is concerned u cud get it from ffc , lulu , giant or any nurseries ... enjoy gardening ...

what ever you bring , be sure to check that it can take both 110v and 220v . do n't take that for granted that all electrical appliances from there will take 220v as we have here .

qs , along salwa road there
qs , along salwa road there are numerous tire shops . mostly they have a big sign for the brand they sell . here in qatar it is not neccessary to buy high speed rated tires -LRB- hr -RRB- type , because the speed limit in this country is 120 km/h . i have an american car and i buy american tires , `` cooper '' . if you have a japanese car , buy japanese tires -LRB- bridgestone -RRB- , if you have a european car buy dunlop or michelin . -LRB- but it does n't really matter much . the speed limit counts everywhere in qatar -RRB-
go to bridgestone/gettco showroom
i recently got tires from there . they are 20 % more expensive than the korean . it is worth it . just make sure the tires are made in japan . they are located right after thursday/friday market roundabout along salwa rd towards industrial area . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = http://www.qatarliving.com/node/58409

how to get a visa without nso authenticated marriage certificate ? or any other options ? please help !!
to all my fellow filipinos please advice . . i just asked my wife , she said it will take time for us to get a nso authenticated marriage certificate , we only have the original marriage certificate from our local civil registrar ... can we used this to get a visit visa for her ? what are our options ?
re : how to get a visa without nso authenticated marriage ...
applying for an nso authenticated mc only takes 1 week , and if you applied for a visa , will take you another week , plus translation in the embassy will take you roughly 1 week . so , what 's the rush ? ministry of interior will ask you to get the stamp from the embassy , and in order for you to get that from our embassy , it needs to be from the nso . if you 're really in a hurry , buy a business visa , or book her in a hotel and get the 1 month tourist visa . if you want the 6 month family visit , you need the proper document .
re : how to get a visa without nso authenticated marriage ...
if you need a 6 months family visa you need to undergo all those procedures . but if your wife will not stay more than 1 month here in doha you can go to hotel to apply for tourist visa . la villa palace hotel is issuing a 1 month tourist visa for only 500 qr . you can call this no . to inquire 4367301 .
re : how to get a visa without nso authenticated marriage ...
if you really want a family visa , you do n't have a choice but to do it by the book and get an nso authenticated mc . what 's the rush anyway . . it 's better to get the authenticated copy anyway because im sure you 'll need it for other purposes as well .
re : how to get a visa without nso authenticated marriage ...
only 1 month maximum , you can get your nso authenticated certificate . just go directly to an nso office near you . and you may also need the dfa seal -LRB- red ribbon seal -RRB- . that makes it more official .
re : how to get a visa without nso authenticated marriage ...
for visit visa , as far as i know is that it its fime to have a stamped marriage certificate from you civil registrar . you will just pass it in the immigration unless it will be for family residence visa , a nso authenticated one is required . try in wakra immigration the captain there was absolutely nice . .

if its small amount you may can pay in lump sum . if not speak to the credit & collection department of that particular bank & say that youre currently working in qatar . -LRB- you may have to send the appointment letter -RRB- . that youre looking at option of settling the same and ask how to go about it . or you can speak to the local bank here in qatar and issue a standing order to transfer cash every month to your respective bank in uae . if you do not wish bank to know that youre working here in qatar . you can ask one of your relative or a friend -LRB- whom you can trust -RRB- to deposit on behalf of you to credit card account . you can remit cash every month to your friend in uae
re : unsettled credit card
you better settle it soon ! i am told that uae has an agreement with all the gcc countries for non payment issues . you pass by the immigration anywhere in gcc , you will be sent to uae jail . this is not hearsay . it has happened in my husband 's workplace ! take care ...
re : unsettled credit card
thanks for all comments.i would like to pay but is it possible to avoid or reduce intrest ?
re : unsettled credit card
first check how many months payment is delay and then which bank is that if you have local bank like -LRB- emirates bank , dubai islamic bank , nbd bank etc -RRB- then for sure after 3 months delay payment you will get travel ban . once you will go to airport same time they will take you to immigration jail al aweer you will be having a court next day , and after 15 days will be your sentence remember the pending payment is one hunderd or one hunderd thousand the punishment will be only 40 days only . and if its international bank like rbs , hsbc , barclays then its not too strickt you can convence them but once its travel ban even bank can not remove till you will not pay . go to online service of the bank send them mail comunicate with them they will give you solution even you are any where in the bank you can pay them . best of luck ... ... ... !
how do i bring equipment into doha ?
i 'd like to bring my large professional video camera -LRB- canon xlh1 -RRB- into doha . is there a procedure that i need to follow ? or an organisation that i can contact to find this kind of information out from ? many thanks .
re : how do i bring equipment into doha ?
just put it under your arm and carry it in , no problem .
re : how do i bring equipment into doha ?
good morning , there 's no regulations for getting such an item like yours , i would suggest getting it through either fedex or dhl , as both would guarantee the safe trip for your camera :-RRB- -RRB- good luck .
re : how do i bring equipment into doha ?
i work for dhl and have handled such cases for al jazeera telivision ... i can assure you safe transit from the destination into qatar including all customs formalities . you can reach me at arjun.balaraman@dhl.com for more details
re : how do i bring equipment into doha ?
its ok to bring that camera when u get here tell them its ur personal camera thats it coz as im working in the same field as you are . . i can suggest u to it will work . any problem u can mail me to majed@dtm.com,qa
re : how do i bring equipment into doha ?
check with the airline , if they allow to carry as in-flight luggage , no problem with customs otherwise through you luggage or courier service .
re : how do i bring equipment into doha ?
all of the above answers are good . the most cost effective is for you to carry it in , as long as the camera is going to be for personal use and not proffesional use . there is no issue . if you are going to use it for work , you have to go through the normal channels to get approval . send me a message i will give you more details . having said that the xlh1 is not a large camera , so carry it with your hand luggage .

prescription medicine .
i am thinking of taking senior work position in qatar . i am uk citizen and take seroxat -LRB- paroxetine -RRB- as prescription medicine . am i allowed to bring this into qatar ? i am not sure how this medicine is viewed within qatar as a country.any advice please ? thanks
bring your prescription
i do n't exactly know what type of medicine you have mentioned . just a piece of advice , bring your prescription with you . here in qatar , you can not buy antibiotics without the prescription .
as far as i know it is for
as far as i know it is for sale in the pharmacy with no prescription but some drugs have recently been regulated . next time i go i will have a look . if it is available it should n't be difficult to get a physician to prescribe if you had to but bring a good supply with you as you never know when things change here .
ant-depressant classification
it is classified as an anti-depressant type drug . i suppose my question is , is it legal for me to bring it as a prescription into qatar . thanks
it 's fine to bring these
it 's fine to bring these drugs in as long as you have a copy of the prescription but , yes , you can buy it over the counter anyway .
you will have no problems ,
you will have no problems , do n't worry about it . get a stockpile in the uk as a prescription there is a shed load cheaper than paying the retail price .

a quick question to arab speaking muslims
whilst waiting for my flight to dubai to take off , the pilot started to speak in arabic . he said `` allah ackbar '' -LRB- god is great -RRB- and then carried on speaking.this speech wasnt translated into english so i have no idea what he said . does anybody know what he said please ?
i 'd rather have no prayers
i 'd rather have no prayers on board an aircraft . no matter which god you believe in , i 'm sure , in your book , he 's doing a great job . but , surely the remainder of the passengers that are not religious , would not appreciate their fate being left in the hands of a god they do n't believe in . pilots are supposed to do checklists , not prayers . just seen from a non-religious passengers point of view . if everything seems under control , you 're just not going fast enough ...
pm
i can understand that . . like when i hear something in chinese :-RRB- one of the prophet 's companions used to hear the prophet and his companions say rhetoric supplication so he expressed his disappointment to the prophet that he can not say what they can saying that he only asked god for paradise and sought refuge from hellfire . so the prophet told him : around that we supplicate . prayers or supplications should n't be complicated .
or even better cargodog
why do n't you just not fly whichever air carriers who you believe do not meet your minimum safety standard requirements ... of course that would mean that you need to personally check on each pilot and make sure he or she does not secretly place his faith on a god you do n't believe in ... actually , i was just being diplomatic ... what i was actually saying is that what you just said earlier was utter rubbish
i suspect it is what muslims
i suspect it is what muslims should say upon each travel . if it was that , which i believe it was , then here is what it said in arbic written by english followed by its translation : -LRB- allaahu ` akbar , allaahu ` akbar , allaahu ` akbar , subhaanal-lathee sakhkhara lanaa haathaa wa maa kunnaa lahu muqrineen . wa ` innaa ` ilaa rabbinaa lamunqaliboon . allaahumma ` innaa nas ` aluka fee safarinaa haathal-birrawattaqwaa , waminal - ` amalimaa tardhaa , allaahumma hawwin ` alaynaa safaranaa haathaa watwi ` annaa bu ` dahu , allaahumma ` antas-saahibu fis-safari , walkhaleefatu fil - ` ahli , allaahumma ` innee ` a ` oothu bika min wa ` thaa'is - safari , wa ka'aabanl - mandhari , wa soo'il - munqalabi fil-maaliwal ` ahli allah is the most great . allah is the most great . allah is the most great . glory is to him who has provided this for us though we could never have had it by our efforts . surely , unto our lord we are returning . o allah , we ask you on this our journey for goodness and piety , and for works that are pleasing to you . o allah , lighten this journey for us and make its distance easy for us . o allah , you are our companion on the road and the one in whose care we leave our family . o allah , i seek refuge in you from this journey 's hardships , and from the wicked sights in store and from finding our family and property in misfortune upon returning . -RRB-
pm : i 'm not saying i would
pm : i 'm not saying i would get offended . i 'm saying pilots should be doing checklists not prayers . people can pray all they want , and they can leave everything in life to god , just not when i 'm on board the aircraft . i do n't believe in god to get me down safely , i do believe in the pilots to get me down safely . veri : it 's actually not rubbish . following link is an example where pilots have relied on god to get them down , but he failed . maybe if they had done their job proper , those people would n't be dead today . that 's all i 'm saying . http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/25/court-in-italy-convicts-pilot-who-prayed-before-crash/ as one of the readers have written in his comment to this article : `` the lord may be my shepherd , but i dont want him as my pilot '' . if everything seems under control , you 're just not going fast enough ...

'' does n't mean `` i do mind that they all leave ... '' in other words , i 'm not saying everyone is leaving everything to god , but some do and it only takes one bad apple . that 's all i said . ql : i can handle religion just fine . i just ca n't handle when religious people ca n't handle the truth . veri : nope , the one thing i can promise you i would n't do if i knew we were crashing , is scream `` i believe , i believe ...

this happened during the
this happened during the prohpet 's time , after finishing a prayer , a man got outside the mosque and did not find his camel which he left . the man , surprised , said i depended on god ! -LRB- which we should do -RRB- and the prophet replied , tie it and depend on god ! so i agree with those who should confirm checklist is completed and not just depending on god while the tank would run out halfway !
pm
it 's not recorded . the pilot says it after going through his checklist . it only takes 10 seconds .
ql dua is recorded this doesnt mean pilots dont supplicate
alhumdullilah most of them are in wudu as-sunnah as saheeha http://www.islamlecture.com/
eco-savvy
yes probably it 's recorded becasue sometimes pilots are non-muslims .
verisi good that cargodog has not travelled jeddah sector
entire journey is nothing but glorification subhanallah as-sunnah as saheeha http://www.islamlecture.com/
recorded or not ... . why
recorded or not ... . why would any pilot say that in the first place . aana free , jaana free , pakde gaye tho khana free .
he said fasten your seat
he said fasten your seat belts . . right ?
no , cos it would have also been said in english as well

i think harry was being flippant . . if rajah park is silly enough to ask such a question then he / she deserves a flippant answer . . i prsonally think that this is a troll having fun at our expense . . there have been too many similar threads from so called filipinas lately . .
britepat
thats ur opinion . . for me its never silly to ask such question like this when u know that sometimes we need some advise . . ur culture our culture is different when its comes to marriage we do n't give up that easily . . as long as we could keep the marriage . . this things happen to me its not a joke or what . . i just need some advise and m taking my time to think rather than decide and regret later . .
rajah park do n't leave him
my answer in no , you hug him and give lot of love so he never do/think that mistake.only way is that think ... `` helping hands r better than praying lips ''
if he 's cheating on you then
if he 's cheating on you then show him the door ... simple ... he would never accept you cheating so why should you ... and for all those `` idiots '' who are telling you its a normal thing as a guy , i think they are talking a lot of bs ... when you marry you marry with the aim of staying together ... if you can not keep it in your pants -LRB- guys -RRB- or gals then separate and go your own ways ... being unfaithful is something that no matter how many times you say you will forgive never happens ... its there in your mind forever and eats away at you ...

there is a difference . . she is a faithful lady wanting to save her marriage . . he 's a low life . .
geographically divorced
rajah park just consider yourself geographically divorced .
nafisa4u
i like your thinking ... : o -RRB-
why
the question is that why he is diverted to hang around with other women , and why the other women like to have an affiar with him , your qustion did not justify for one gender , what about wife is not faithful ... :--RRB- :--RRB- a house divided against itself can not stand :
mom_me , it was ' t me
i hope it was ' t me a house divided against itself can not stand :
rajah_park
i think you are just looking for excuses to ` stay ' with him . ou know the answer perfectly well yourself . there are no excuses for cheating ... if you want to stay married .
hahaha . . rajah ... u know the
hahaha . . rajah ... u know the answer urself . i think u r not that stupid to realize by now if he is faithful or not . my next question is . . if u still trust him ? if not , then its time for you to move on . otherwise , ur a masochist .
its very sad reading about
its very sad reading about the number of such cases in the filipino community . . poor wife in home country whilst the guy has a mistress here . the embassy should help in these matters . .
to answer the question on -
faithful - truthful , loyal , or true -LRB- to you -RRB- . as for relationships broken caused by being away w / each other , only your guilt of conscience can help you realized that . it 's a matter of choosing your own destiny .
ram
it does n't matter if your wife tell you such . if you do n't wan na have an affair , you just do n't . respect your wife as you respect yourself . treathening is not the cure for cheating or lying or whatever ! `` so wag kang nega ! bixoxa !! ''
franelizabeth , just for
franelizabeth , just for curiosity sake , did you let her husband know ? i ask because i was in a similar situation . only it was my friend/colleague . she used to have fun while her family/husabnd thought she was with me / busy in a business meeting . whenever her husband called to inquire i had to lie -LRB- as she asked me to before leaving with her bf -RRB- . i thought it was ` nt my business to interfere in her private affair - but once her husband asked me directly if there is another man in her life and i had to lie . she is no more a friend but i carry a guilt because i know her husband really cared for her and looked after the kids in her absence .

we have no right to judge people eh !!!
darling , unfaithful is just a word , nobody really give a important to it.men are men if they slept with other ladies it does n't mean he loves her or he is ready to give up his family hey !! come on . . if you only look on scientific side its so simple ... men needs to ejaculate once or twice a month -LRB- if i 'm right ? -RRB- but , anyway , they have to for health reason how they do it , its up to them . for women we do n't need because we menstrual period every month . and husband without his wife on his side is very difficult.the stress of everyday routine . sometimes you have to understand that men are not saint . as a wife you know your husband very well . women working away from home like middle east are not looking for married man because of sex experience . . they are looking for `` knight in a shining armor '' shoulder to lean on . stable and good paying job , huge bank account one who can give them what they want.easy life.extra curricular activities for free.mostly no string attached . hey ! its not the end of the world welcome to computer age . . you can do something productive than crying and feeling sorry for yourself you can twist everything its all up to you.cheers
rajah
just because he is here and you are there , is no reason to accept his unfaithfulness . just like him , you are alone ... have you cheated on him ? my guess is no . you have to make the decision as to what you can live with and what you ca n't . do n't just take it because he 's a man ... be a woman and have respect enough for yourself and do what is right for you and children . when he returns , have him get tested for any and all sexually transmitted diseases before you let him back in the house because if he has them , so will you if you let him back in your bed . if you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous , he will not bite you ; that is the main difference between a dog and man . - mark twain -
whoa liliachalmers ...
men do n't have to ejaculate each month !! who in the world fed you that line of bs ???!!! there is no health reason for this `` need '' . men and women 's sex drives are basically the same . . its how its dealt with that 's different . you are giving the male the excuse to go find someone to have sex with because he `` needs '' to ??? get real !! there is no biological requirement for that . and even if there was , they can always give themselves a helping hand . . they do n't have to go looking for a woman to have an affair with . geez ... get real . . if you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous , he will not bite you ; that is the main difference between a dog and man . - mark twain -
rajah it depends on how you
rajah it depends on how you found out ! , is it thru your own knowledge , or just a message from your friend , or your relatives gave you that information . sometimes it is very deceiving when things came up into our minds . here is a classic sample . . the boss and the secretary . . one day the two of them drove to the hotel , someone saw them while entering into the hotel , after an hour , the two left the hotel . this witness spread the news that the two have an affair , they went to the hotel to release their desire . -LRB- take note the witness was n't sure what really happen inside the hotel -RRB- the truth is , the boss and the secretary went to the hotel to talk to the manager of how they can promote their company with the help of the hotel . for the meantime just trust your husband . . he maybe unfaithful as what they say but still he is your husband and the father to your kids . <a href="http://cgi.godsview.com/cgi-bin/rcdenig/pdchap.pl?file=3753&occ=27"> rache ist bergwerk saith der lord </a>

duration of stay for tourist visa ?
help !!! my friend came to qatar last 29 august using a tourist visa . he is on his way to change his tourist visa to rp but he is quite concerned that his rp may not come out before the eid holidays . they were telling that theres no work for immigration for 10 days due to eid holidays that might start next friday or saturday . how long will he be able to stay in qatar ? is there a way to extend his tourist visa ?
re : duration of stay for tourist visa ?
yes , you need to go to the immigration building # 4 , madinah khalifa . first of all , ask the typist -LRB- outside building # 4 -RRB- to type ur tourist visa extention application , then go to building # 4 with that application and original passport . they will charge u qr 100 / - for one month visa extention .
re : duration of stay for tourist visa ?
thanks . he really needs that info . he is quite afraid that he will go exit if his rp does not come out before the eid holidays . he was only issued a 30 day tourist visit .
re : duration of stay for tourist visa ?
hello friend , i do not think tourist visa is extendable beyond 1 month . because , 6 months back i have arranged tourist visa for one of my relatives to come to qatar through cleopatra travels . at the time of applying visa itself , pro of travel agent had warned that it was strictly unextendable . the simple logic is if there is any chance for renewal , the process must start from sponsor i.e. travel agent and defnitely not by us . anyway , you may enquire at immigration at garaffa . so my advice is better not to take any risk or chances of overstay since the penalties are hefty . good luck .
re : duration of stay for tourist visa ?
dear speedmark , did you try it out ... please tell me also ... since mine is alos the same case with my wife . . i hoped that her rp could be done in this month but it willd efinitly get extended . so i am also worried about the same . any clue ?
re : duration of stay for tourist visa ?
dear vinith , the travel agency that we took the tourist visit visa told us that tourist visas can not be extended beyond 30 days of stay . they offered us to make an exit to bahrain and go back to doha for a new 30-day tourist visa . however , we opted that to transfer his tourist visa to business visa to the company that hired him and without going out of the country . it will be easy for him to transfer from business visa to rp because his sponsor is his company .

gatorade for kids ?
my kids -LRB- 2 yrs and 9 yrs -RRB- loves to drink gatorade , i know gatorade is an energy drink -LRB- for rehydration -RRB- mostly for athletes ... its is safe for their age . ??
re : gatorade for kids ?
energy drinks are often mixed with alcohol . where energy drinks are stimulants , alcohol is a depressant . the mix can be particularly hazardous as energy drinks can mask the influence of alcohol and a person can fail to take its effects into consideration . -LSB- 21 -RSB- normally fatigue would set in as large amounts of alcohol are being consumed , but the stimulating effect of energy drinks can override this effect . -LSB- 22 -RSB- often drunk with vodka or in shots it has lead to increase in the purchase of pre-mixed drinks also known as alco-pops often containing guarana or taurine extract which provides energy drinks with their flavour . avoid giving them , make them to drink fruit juice .
re : gatorade for kids ?
hi abno , thank you for your advice . . recently i read that information in wikepedia . . anyway thanks a lot.god bless . .
re : gatorade for kids ?
what i give you now is not a wikepedia cut & paste . most of the energy drinks consists of stimulants , some of which are used as `` doping '' by the athletes . initially the drink may give you sudden outburst of energy , but studies showed that such stimulants weakens the nervous system in the long run .
re : gatorade for kids ?
gatorade does not have alcohol and is not considered an `` energy '' drink such as red bull . gatorade helps to replenish electrolytes and carbohydrates that are lost when participating in physical activities . it is also a good drink to have when you have been ill to your stomach .

where can i get my makeup done for less than 200
at which salon does it cost less to get your makeup done ?
re : where can i get my makeup done for less than 200
its very hard to say that you can find or done your make-up less then 200 bc normaly rates are according to the occasion.i 'm a make-up artist and my charges for model or party make-up 300qr and then go on and on so obviously saloon takes more then that but hopes maybe any saloon did this job so cheaply .
re : where can i get my makeup done for less than 200
its very hard to say that you can find any make-up services at this rate , i 'm a make-up artist and my rates for model or party make-up is 350qr and then go on and on , obviously saloon takes more then that , normaly rates are according to the occasion so hopes and also wish that you can find or did your make-up at this rate or maybe you 'll find any saloon who did this jobn at very cheep rates .
re : where can i get my makeup done for less than 200
i agree with the fact that it depends on the occassion ... but dear i can tell you something that will be a good help for you . during weekends there are usually make-up artist that came from european countries who came to qatar to promote what ever brand of make-up they are selling . it usually happens at sephora , debenhams , highland and the likes . you will be lucky if the occassion that you need to go to falls on weekend . they can do your make up for free ! well almost ... because you need to buy at least 1 of their items . but at least you get your make done by a real proffessional for a fraction of the price . hope this thought helps you . good luck !
anyone know how is al bayyan compound ?
we are thinking of moving to al bayyan compound . anyone know how is the management and the facilities are they well maintained ?
re : anyone know how is al bayyan compound ?
not good
re : anyone know how is al bayyan compound ?
al bayan compound used to be only for qatar petroleum employees only until recently when they have allowed a certain amount of villas to be let out to outside people . generally the compound is good for the price you are paying for it . decent size swimming pool . rooms are quite big size . it has a shop etc. . so on a whole for the price that they are charging it is a good deal . if you want better than you have to pay more .
re : anyone know how is al bayyan compound ?
thank you ukengqatar . your input is very helpful .
re : anyone know how is al bayyan compound ?
based on what i heard from friends who lived there temporarily -LRB- newly hired qp employees -RRB- , or renting there : pros : - it is decent for the price - location is pretty ok - villas are good size cons : - temporary accommodations for qp newly-hired , high turnover of tenants - furniture is horrible , old and bulky - area gets very congested near saad stadium when there is a game when it comes to housing , it is relative and greatly depends on your life style and what you are used to . i would say visit a few times and see a few villa 's before you make your decision .

iphone advice , please !
should i buy an iphone here in the us and bring it to doha -LRB- have it unlocked there -RRB- or should i wait until i move to doha in august ? will vodaphone be up and running then ? any advice is helpful ! thanks !
re : iphone advice , please !
i think it would be better to the buy the iphone here . you get a warranty although its a bit expensive here . and about the unlocking bit , fear not cuz it 's a 2-minute thing .
re : iphone advice , please !
i would suggest to buy it from here in qatar but it 's rather expensive . . got mine at qrs 2500 . you can also buy it from the us and have it jailbroken here . . softwares -LRB- for unlocking and jailbreaking -RRB- are also available on the net , specifically on ebay . the problem is that 3g iphones does n't have an unlocking software yet in the market . . only for 2gs ... just check first before purchasing or you 'll end up with a phone that does n't support the network . have you considered buying a nokia 5800 instead of an iphone ? : p
re : iphone advice , please !
i got mine from uk and unlocked it here , had a look in the us as well , but could n't find one with no contract , but it is definately cheaper than buying in doha
re : iphone advice , please !
you can not enjoy some of the features that is offered loacally if you buy us unit . and you may spend more of unlocking . local unit though more expensive but with warranty and guaranteed you will enjoy all features .

not that impressed ,
not that impressed , overpriced - the concept is apparently upmarket pub grub but at michelin star prices . usual stroy in qatar - let us rip the expat off who are so stupid as to go there . his michelin starred french food restaurant in claridges in london is not as expensive as the bloody burger you get . better food to be had elsewhere in town . another note , like most food outlets on the pearl , expect to be ripped off , over priced and bad . except carluccios which is ok .
i understand , its chef
i understand , its chef ramsey its supposed to be expensive , but how expensive is expensive is the question

freeway ply over

re : freeway ply over
possibly to do with the contractor not getting paid .
re : freeway ply over

re : freeway ply over
if i were not mistaken that project was more than 5 years now ... as far as i know , they started working that project way back 2004 and still not yet finished . i presumed there is a long long way to finished this project since it was completely stopped ang long overdue .
re : freeway ply over
doha expressway project original completion date was sept 2008 . it was pushed back to sept 2009 but now the payment dispute between ashagal and the contractor has put it on hold indefinately . it is a terrible shame and i hope the qatari citizens voice their displeasure loudly enough to get the problem solved quickly . the officials in charge should be held accountable .

a number of my students
a number of my tuition students are from parkhouse . there seems to be little support for those who lag behind in a particular subject . also the number of uk qualified teachers with qts -LRB- qualified teacher status -RRB- is limited . you may wish to ask how many of the teachers actually have qts compared to those that do n't . many of the teachers are not from the uk and do so not have a background of teaching a british curriculum . finally , parkhouse only follows part of the national curriculum of england and wales . the rest of the curriculum is based around what is referred to as the international curriculum , which is created by a private company in the uk and is not endorsed by the government . this topic has been discussed a number of times previously so you may wish to do a search to get a better idea of the school . you may also wish to try other uk curriculum schools such as doha college , dess , sherborne and the international school of london . good luck .
schools
as a user of the qatari and british education systems for my children let me tell you that if you have a good teacher , your child and you are lucky ! usually here about 1 in 5 teachers have that power to inspire your child ! be glad when you get one , no matter what school they are paid by ! education is about inspiring children to progress , not about checking off what they have studied !
craftyqueen , let me tell you
craftyqueen , let me tell you that all the children who are not as good in reading as the rest of their colleagues are taken away from their normal classes , given to a volunteer parent -LRB- who is given a bunch of flashcards with no further instructions -RRB- who is supposed to help them develop reading skills . not only is that wrong , but on top of it they miss what is happening in their class . and do n't try and tell me it 's not true - i was a volunteer parent last schoolyear for year 1 . is this the way to save on spending more time with the children who need more reading practice ? why not do like the french school - extra hours of tuition after school ? last swimming competition the kids were so excited to show what they could do - instead the swimming teacher used her own son to get a better place for park house . the amount of dissapointed faces of children was heartbreaking ! waiting hours for nothing ? things are far less positive then what you make them seem !
alumnar i am surprised you
alumnar i am surprised you are willing to say negative comments about the school your children attend on ql . maybe you should change schools for your kids and give those parents who would remove their right arm to put their kids into park house their place . in the uk all primary schools ask parents to come into the lower primary classes to hear the children read . i ca n't understand what could be better than one-to-one reading . if you want to suggest a reading group after school which parents fund i am sure the school would be interested in your suggestion . in the uk books were changed once a week - here in park house its three times a week , their books are set based on their individual ability into small groups if possible . the teacher hears the pupil read at least once a week . parents are asked to participate in their child 's learning by listening to their child read at home . schooling is not a vacuum - a child can learn at anytime anywhere . as for fairness - the world is not fair and no school can be fair 100 % to everyone because not everyone agrees on what is fair - its personal opinion . if a child is brought up thinking the world is fair they will get many shocks when it comes to finding a job !
parkhouse
some of the comments that have been made on this thread are more than a little misleading . for example , are we comparing parkhouse -LRB- or any other school in doha -RRB- with fee-paying , independent schools in the uk or are we trying to compare them with state schools in britain ? as parkhouse is a fee-paying school , i would have thought that the former would be a fairer point of comparison . one person has written that the standards at parkhouse are `` extremely high '' . well , if there is an acute shortage of school places , then it stands to reason that some of the more popular schools can be very selective about who they allow in through the gates . i have not heard much about parkhouse 's special educational needs policies and i suspect that they would not want to admit sen children because that might affect their `` extremely high standards '' . that also might explain parkhouse 's preference for nice , white english children . craftyqueen has mentioned the sec , the supreme council of education . this is a body set up by the qatari government and it is most probably run by a bunch of idiots . therefore it stands to reason that anything endorsed or recommended by the sec must be pretty awful . if the sec were really so smart and so super efficient , then there would not be any private , fee-paying schools in doha at all because every single parent would want their little darling to go to a wonderful qatari school . in reality the qatari schools are very bad and more foreign , fee-paying schools open every year and most parents -LRB- both qatari and expat -RRB- seem to want their children to go to `` international schools '' . and have you ever heard of such a thing as a qatari teacher ? no , i thought not .
any update ??
dear all , some comments were positive & some were negative . . this was in 2010 ... now we are in 2012 ... ccould anyone update his point of view ... or share his kids experience as a parent ?? because i 'm about to put my two kids there . . thanks : -RRB-
should n't parents take
should n't parents take responsibility for their children 's education ? call me stupid but if your child is lagging behind in reading writing or what ever should n't you as a parent take time out and do it with them at home ? . instead of blaming the schools/teachers for this.education starts at home ! : -RRB-
should n't parents take responsibility ?
i dislike having to disagree with a fellow hippopotamus , but i do not think that pink hippo17 's comments are very sensible . many expat parents in doha are not trained teachers . they are engineers , doctors or whatever , but they are not teachers . that is why they pay lots of school fees and send their children to school , in order for the children to be educated by trained teachers who are supposed to know what they are doing . yes , of course very young children learn a lot from their parents , but a lot of parents simply do not have the time , the training , the experience or the resources to teach their children at home . as for sen children -LRB- those who have special educational needs -RRB- , i think that it would be true to say that there is a lot of pressure on many schools in doha to focus on the more able students and to ignore the needs of children who are struggling . this is particularly the case in fee-paying schools . schools that want to boast about their `` high academic standards '' do not want to give school places to children who might not be able to live up to these high expectations . sen children usually need additional individual help and -LRB- surprise , surprise -RRB- that usually costs money . for many children in `` british '' school , primary education is , first and foremost , all about language development . even a maths or a science lesson is really all about the english language , as english will be the medium of instruction and a good grasp of the english language , both spoken and written , will be needed by the students if they are going to participate in the lesson and produce written work based on what they have learned . therefore there is a lot of pressure on schools like park house to reject non-british children and to offer school places to nice , white english-speaking children who have nice , white english-speaking parents .
wow , i did n't realise you had
wow , i did n't realise you had to be a trained teacher to help your own kids ! . . if my son has n't understood or struggled at school as parents me and my hubby are always there to help , that 's all i 'm getting at . . some parents have n't got the time , your words . . sad that ! :-LRB- we 've been paying school fee 's for years , so yes , you expect a high standard from the school who would n't ? . . but what would i know , i 'm just a nice white english-speaking parent ! : -RRB-

no qatar82 i do not work for
no qatar82 i do not work for hsbc but if you really want figures , for a relations manager , you could expect a salary of 15,000-20 ,000 , you could negotiate for a higher pay if you have good working experience ! i have worked in the financial services for a long time so i have some idea .
hello , band 6 grade for a hsbc
hello , band 6 grade for a hsbc bank employee is also good enough for a person with a bachelor 's degree as well as a financial banking diploma with relevant work experience , i mean at the financial services . salaries are paid according to the industry situations and of course position offered , what position they offer you ?

manual or automatic
which car is better manual or automatic ?
re : manual or automatic
personally , in qatar ; auto . there are so many idiots around that it is much easier to concentrate fully on the road , rather than the gears . there is also not alot of ` smooth ' driving in doha ; lots of stop , start , stop at traffic signals , so automatic saves all that ' 1st gear , neautral ' arm-work . just my opinion !
re : manual or automatic
due to traffic congestion , preference for automatic gear . if you buy new vehicle , then go for automatic gear vehicle . manual gear vehcile is going away from the current market .
re : manual or automatic
it is preferable to go for automatic for ease of driving and better focus on road to reach your destination ... ... ... more importantly traffic is growing in gcc and if u intend to drive down to dubai ... ... ... than better have automatic car to ease ur tension and stress building on roads ... ... ... . .
re : manual or automatic
for girls : automatic for boys : automatic is better bt still manual is ok

price trend
what is the recent price trend of new cars in qatar . any impact of auto crisis in gm chrysler ford etc here ? thanks
re : price trend
there is an approx.qr6k jump for the 2009 models of japanese cars -LRB- eg . honda civic -RRB-
re : price trend
i am sure price will come down by march - 2009 . honda crv reduced price by 7000qr . chevrolet is offering free service up to 30000km & free petrol up to 30000km . in middle east the price of car in qatar is highest . dealers are taking huge profit . steel price is reduced by 60 % . i am sure that car price will come down .
re : price trend
usually , my advice would be to wait till end of march , when the whole financial year gets over where they can tally and c what improvements they can do for the next coming years . but even thou the world crisis are there ... nothing really changed out here in qatar .
re : price trend
chevrolet is a nice car .

does anyone know where to get a money order ?
in the us you can get them at banks and almost any store or western union . where can i get one here in qatar ? i do not want to transfer money but i need to send a check and a personal check wo n't work .
re : does anyone know where to get a money order ?
hi how r u well come qatar i think u check habib excange in national area if u not find i guide u wish u all the best god bless u happy x mass u jan
re : does anyone know where to get a money order ?
i believe the money exchanges at city center -LRB- across from carrefour -RRB- has western union .
re : does anyone know where to get a money order ?
yeah , here 's the one at city center ; qatar uae exchange city center branch level n 1 shop n 66 doha , 31645 +974 -- 4115031 for more , google western union doha . i got almost 50 results !
re : does anyone know where to get a money order ?
no , i 'm not looking for western union here unless you know that they can provide money orders -LRB- i do n't think they do -RRB- . i 'm looking to get a money order , where can i get one ?
re : does anyone know where to get a money order ?
hi ! there is trust exchange , in national , there is eastern exchange near q tel signal in musheirib , then there in also habib qatar exchange , in the national area . you can go to any of this exchange and transfer you money .
re : does anyone know where to get a money order ?
money order can be obtained in post office . try visiting one and inquire .
re : does anyone know where to get a money order ?
depends on where u want to send money , most exchanges will give a certified cheque drawn on a bank in the receiving country a low rate , most indians seem to send their money this way , costs only a few riyals rather than the 30 riyals my exchange charges or the much higher western union rates . i have used it to issue cheques in the uk and the eurozone much cheaper than a telegraphic transfer but u have the postal delay and have to wait for the cheque to clear . go to a good exchange , they may have an account the country ure interested in . above all do n't send your money thru the banks as their rates are higher . try the post office as well and make ur choice good luck

ubl near -LRB- old al ghanim -RRB- cornich is the best option for pakistanies
re : remittance
if you have icici bank account in india from any of your family member , then you can send it through gulf exchange near al fardan . gulf exchange will charge you qar .15 / - transaction and it will get credited in 12 working hours , means if you deposit in morning , icici account in india will be get credited by evening and also they pay a good exchange rate compare to other exchanges in doha . the only you need for this is icici bank account number , name of the account holder , branch , and amount . this service is known as instant transfer , you can check or ask about icici transfer on indian counters available in gulf exchange . i prefer this is the safe way compare to western union , amount ger directly credited in indian bank account also high rupee value compare to western union .

is it cheaper than uk in qatar
i 'm moving to doha in next month or so with work . i wan na buy a few things for while i 'm there , like new laptop , blackberry phone , digital camera and some good clothes . is it cheaper to buy these sorta things in qatar than in uk ?
its better to pack all frm

well petrol is thats about all ... ... ...
only petrol
japanese musical equipment
japanese musical equipment is about 30 to 40 % cheaper here ! no vat , only 4 % import tax .
buy all that at
dixons duty free and save the vat . i saved 150 pound on my mac at heathrow . pretty much all electronics are more expensive here than any where in the world . pocket digital cameras average about 60-100 pound more . i saw a laptop i brought my dad in the uk going for almost double here in carrefour . i find it cheaper to shop at amazon and pay aramex to ship it here and it 's still cheaper !! obviously this wo n't work with a huge tv but everything else get back home . also anyone with a residents permit for qatar can buy stuff in the uk and get the vat back at the airport . always remember to do this when you buy expensive things on your holidays .

arranged marriage to a 6 year
arranged marriage to a 6 year old is poplar in some parts of the world . more like child abuse to me
well , since we have 2 species
well , since we have 2 species now , the arranged marriage and the love marriage , let things go full circle and invent the `` arranged love marriage '' .
hi
love with arrange
anything but arranged
anything but arranged marriage ... either way , most people get miserable after getting married lol .
love marriage . why ? because
love marriage . why ? because i 'm old enough to make my bed ...
love marriage
both ... its different in the beggining but later same . personally i will say love because i neva wan na be with stangers .
well
this debate is indeed an endless one . usually , those who are comfortable in their marriage would always have you believe that it is arranged marriage or love marriage , whatever their specific case , which is better . on the contrary , those who are not happy in their marriage will always claim that the form of the marriage other than they had is better . the fact is that there is simply no way to tell which one is better . for some people love marriage works magic , for others arranged marriage opens the heaven 's door . to a large extent , it luck .
thanks ! indeed ! eternal love is what we promised to each other !

i mean it 's not an endless discussion , but letting people choose for you who you will be staying for maybe the rest of your life is just plainly unthinkable , unless you have some really bad self - esteem issues that you ca n't do it your own . @jjh and congratulations , hope you 'd be prospering till eternity !

it take a lot of effort to make marriage successful , whether love or arrange ... my opinion chill and let others chill too ... and no two persons can have the same expirences ... its your journey do it your way
if u love someone then marry
if u love someone then marry her but never leave her n go for arrange marriage becoz of someone wish as u will never forget ur loved one n u will always blame the one u married and nt the one who arranged ur marriage . . and if u dnt love anyone then go for arrange marriage and love will come after .
does n't matter get in bed
does n't matter get in bed this way or the other . . :p but seriously , i believe its not the `` kind '' of marriage which makes your marriage life successful . . its the 2 people in it !! i have seen extreme cases in both types of marriages , love or arranged does n't matter .

opinions on facebook
can anybody give me their opinions on facebook . i was thinking about setting up an account , but it wo n't let you check out profiles unless you sign up , unlike myspace which lets you look around before you sign up . is facebook better than myspace or the other way around ?

well ...
well in my opinion , both are good ... facebook has got more popular over the months and even hit headlines ... my space was the same to back then ... it was just as popular just as cool ... but i stuck to the facebook profile since it has loads of games and information ... and is still developin

go ahead and open up a facebook ... it 's easy and it 's free ... i do n't really see a reason not to . keep in mind though that it 's starting to die off ... within 18 months it 's gon na be as popular as icq and something else will come in it 's place .
so if i open up a facebook

yeah definitely ... some people are also a little worried over how their information will be used and stuff but that 's all just good old paranoia . open one up , check it out , and if you do n't like it then deactivate , it 'll be as if you never signed up in the first place : -RRB-

thanks notfromhere , did n't even cross my mind to search for facebook on ql . it would seem to me that if they were a good website you would get to check it out without signing up . usually that procedure gets you into trouble . thanks again for the tip ! motherhood ... the hardest job you 'll ever love ! : -RRB-
nfh ... the only personal info
nfh ... the only personal info you get plastered all over the internet is the info you provide . facebook can not find out anything about you that you do n't tell it ... there is no spyware in it that follows you around to other sites and sees what kind of person you are from other internet activity ... the whole mess about personal information abuse was that it was going to be used as a statistics tool for marketing purposes if you 're uncomfortable with sharing some stuff then do n't ! facebook does n't require any real information from you ... the fact that you can open a fake account proves that facebook is not out there to get you and your personal information though , if it was that kinda site it would be much much harder to open a fake account .
facebook is good . i had a

even if you de-activate your account it is always there ... that is one thing with facebook you can never ever really get rid of the account ... you de-activate and the minute you wan na go back you just log in and its up and running again . i personally do not like it ... but thats my opinion ...

maybe you can bring this cute one . i have seen many here . you just have to comply on some requirements of bringing one here , get some permit and you should have with you his/her birth certificate .
:-RRB- yes he is adorable
would you happen to know which requirements i need to comply ? and which permit i need to get ?

contact qatar pet travel ... they have a good website and will let you know all the details
i think you do n't have
i think you do n't have permission to bring big pet . . so for kind information you should contact qatar pet travel . http://www.amirafoods.com/

great danes are not banned in qatar and big dogs have always been allowed into qatar . whoever you are getting your info from is feeding you false information . please go to www.qatarpetrelocators.com for info and mail contact@qatarpetrelocators.com for assistance with brining your animal . doha is not a bad place for pets . its the same the world over . just because qatar is a small country , it seems like we are over run with animals . just remember that when taking your pet from qatar - europe -LRB- if thats where you go to next -RRB- requires added documentation .
yes , just try contact qatar
yes , just try contact qatar pet travel . i understand your desire of bringing your dane with you . my daughter like your age is also keeping another kind , so adorable and sweet . try search of possibilities of bringing her in .
seriously ?
up to last year big dogs were not allowed . . but things are obviously changing ... as oryx suggested , contact qatar pet travel .
thank you all for answers : -RRB-
i was actualy considering to drive to qatar with the dog . it will be a lot cheaper and it will be an amazing experience ! i just thought that the great dane might have been on the ` ban-list ' in qatar ? but i will try to contact the pet travel company to hear their say
how would you drive here ?
how would you drive here ? you , as a female , are not allowed to drive in saudi arabia . i do n't know where you 're coming from but if , for example , you 're coming from uae - you would need the proper documents issued by the uae authorities/vets , probably documents allowing you to import/transit an animal via saudi -LRB- if a man is doing the driving and if you are married to him , his sister , or his daughter or his mother -RRB- and then more docs to allow the dog to enter qatar . if you 're coming from further afield and have more countries to pass through , it gets even more complicated on the document side . i suspect nearly all of these countries would require a vet inspection by their vet before allowing the dog entry/transit through their country
i will be coming from denmark
and i will of course make sure that the dog is fully vaccinated and have all it 's documents in order - and that goes for every country we will transit . also , i would have my stepfather come and pick me up in saudi , as women are not allowed to drive there . when i was last in doha , i was told that bringing a great dane was illegal and impossible , but now i see that they are only restricted , so i guess i have all my questions answered . luckily my family lives in a big house with a nice garden with the lagoona in the backyard , so apart from the heat , the dog would n't get it any better . : -RRB-
saudi may not recognize your
saudi may not recognize your step father as your step father . you should check that out before making any firm plans .
oh . . maybe you are right . he
oh . . maybe you are right . he is also my sponsor in qatar - do you think that would be enough ?

re : shelf life of tires .
mrst2009 thanks for the joke early in the morning . shelf life for tires is 2 years , 60,000 km or 3 years is after you mount them .
re : shelf life of tires .
from the web ... should tires be assigned a shelf life , like groceries , milk or eggs ? a safety research group says aging tires develop cracks or weaken when they sit around unused . tire makers in britain have just issued a warning to consumers . replace tires that are more than ten years old , even if the treads not worn . and for a tire that hasnt been used , like a spare , replace it after six years . reviewing u.s. lawsuits , the research group says that many accidents involved old tires . according to strategic safety expert sean kane , weve been able to document in a very short period of time at least 20 cases involving serious injuries and fatalities in the united states , and weve only scratched the surface of this issue here . !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but read this one : shelf life not the answer but the u.s. tire industry says a shelf life is not the answer . donald shea of the rubber manufacturers association said : what it is is a complex series of events that can make a tire deteriorate . one , is the amount of mileage ; two is the abuse it takes on the road ; third and perhaps most important is the maintenance that is given or not given to the tire . if the public gets the impression that they could continue to use a tire until that use by date that could send clearly the wrong message . when the nhtsa proposed an upgrade to new tire standards it also proposed an aging standard . that was deferred for two years because no one could agree on a reliable test that could artificially age a tire . the nhtsa is in the process of determining which test is best and hope to have research done by next summer . <!--break-->
re : shelf life of tires .
you can check manufacturing date from the stamp on the side of tire . stamp shows the week and the year tire was manufactured . look for 4 digit number inside rounded rectangle . for example , if you see 4007 it means tire was manufactured on the 40th week of 2007 . similarly if it shows 1208 it was manufactured on the 12th week -LRB- early march -RRB- of 2008 .

tax applicable in qatar for non _ qatari establishments means other than qatar national they have to pay tax . in an expatrate employee is not required to pay tax . but his employer is liable to pay tax if it is not qatari

food price complaint
can any one please give me the details of the goverment department for complaining the high food price of some food items in a hotel compared to other hotels for the same item.it is found to be very heigh than the reasonable price of the item .
i think that is not a reason
i think that is not a reason to complain ... the hotels are managing the prices for the food according to their standards ... it 's not like the alcohol ...
babe , there is a telephone
babe , there is a telephone no . such as 180 to ask which department you can comlplain . otherwise , the gates of emiri diwan is open for your concern . or , try the bakala , he selld definitely cheaper than hotel : - -RRB-
you can go to the hotel
you can go to the hotel providing cheaper option
do you know who owns the
do you know who owns the hotels ? i do n't think you complaint will get very far . plus hotels are not considered a basic requirement of human life . they try to regulate basic food stuffs at supermarkets but not hotels .
i do n't think food in hotels
i do n't think food in hotels can be classed as essential . therefore nothing to complain about . only essential foods are governed here .
the complain is not worth

what is the best way of shipping of boxes to qatar from usa ?
i will be moving to qatar soon from unted states and would like to see what is the best way of shipping my belongings there . thanks
re : what is the best way of shipping of boxes to qatar ...
google and you 'll find some shipping companies . they do n't come cheap . they all have a minimum weight that you 've to pay for , whether or not your stuff weights that much . and you must select it to be shipped via sea . usually reaches doha in about 30 days . this is relatively cheaper way to transport items in excess of 200 lbs to qatar .
re : what is the best way of shipping of boxes to qatar ...
how many boxes and from where in the states ? just shipped out of fl with a 20 ' container , so i may be able to guide you a little .
re : what is the best way of shipping of boxes to qatar ...
try aramex or dhl ... even ups works ... or tnt ...
re : what is the best way of shipping of boxes to qatar ...
over and no ! wow this question keeps popping up constantly . the simple truth is leave your stuff there as you are not moving here permanently ! the money and time you spend shipping items here and back will be the price of the items . do n't waste your time and do n't be so attached to inanimate objects . prices here are reasonable enough that you can get a tv and electronics for almost the same as at home . washers and dryers are actually cheaper - almost half the cost . believe it or not quality mattresses are half the price as well - shows you how much you are gouged in the us . furniture is cheap and will last the time you live here . it 's disposable furniture , replace every 5 years ... count on spending 10 percent of the first year 's salary on air cleaners , dryers , dishwasher if not supplied and you 'll be fine . you can sell everything for half price to co-workers or on qatar living classifieds area and you 'll be ahead of the game . buy your furniture here at homes r us and electronics at carrefour , giant store or lulu and you 'll be comfortable . it will cost you money to ship or to buy so just buy . simple as that .

question about marriage
assalamu 3laikum , can a muslim who is a us citizen marry a qatari woman ? is it illegal by law , or not ? what has to be done for the marriage to take place ?
about culture : i just can not
about culture : i just can not relate to most of the `` arab americans '' . the gulf is where i belong , i follow arab culture in every way . every day i find my desire to live in qatar multiply exponentially . i just do not like western culture , i dont know why i was born in america . it just is not `` me '' , i just can not do anything western , i tried once , and now ask myself why did i even try to be like a westerner ? everything in western culture is backwards to me . this is not my society . its not that i am `` trying too hard '' or anything , but it just comes naturally to me to be arab , and do things the arab way . not every single gulf arab is perfect , i know this , and every country has its problems , but you have to admit , this is a beautiful , traditional country with a lot of history . and to those who said i should marry in europe or usa , what were you thinking when you told me this ?! not only is that illegal , but absolutely wrong . ahhhh my difficult life ; good thing islam prevents me from commiting suicide ...

being arab is n't enough out
being arab is n't enough out here dude . these people , as good as they are discriminate amongst each other over family name and color let alone an outsider coming in . try as you will , come here and it wont take you long to realize you will never belong . you will never be one of them . its an elite club you are born into . these are not insults to these people , i like them very much . i work with one westerner only the rest are qatari . i live in an exclusively qatari neighborhood . i pray with them in the mornings and evenings and sit with them in their homes but the fact is even if i marry one , have kids and die here ... me and the kids i will produce will never be one of them . never . you talk about marrying a girl from here . . their parents know what i say is true and that 's why you will have a hard time to find one to marry and an even harder time keeping one if you do marry her . no one is trying to take anything from you man . these are simple things you need to know before you come out here with altruistic ideas and end up with an angry heart . again , i say you should try saudi or yemen , these issue do not exist to the extent there that they do here . ______________________________________________ brazilian jujitsu in qatar http://iloveqatar.net/bjj/

well , you have to find a qatari girl first -LRB- which is n't logistically easy -RRB- and then get permission from her family . since qatari families usually prefer to have their daughters marry other qataris , often their cousins , you would appear to have an uphill battle . mandi

you need permission from the
you need permission from the qatar government in order for a qatari to marry a non-qatari . in the case of qataris marrying foreigners it is certainly not automatically granted . it is illegal to marry outside of qatar without government permission as well . mandi

supplements from outside qatar
want to buy supplement from us but need to know if any restriction by gov. / health ministry . tq
marisma as per my knowledge
once the suplemments arrive into qatar they will go to customs and also to the health authorities to give the clearance , then you will receive your stuff . if health authorities do not issue the clearance your stuff is simply seized and you might probably end up loosing your money . aramex provides the facility to shop in the us & uk and bring it into qatar however and once again upon arrival the merchandise will need the approval and clearance of the health authorities so you can receive it in your hands . better call them to check if they can help you on this http://www.aramex.com regards !!

is cipralex a controlled drug in qatar ?
is cipralex a controlled drug in qatar ? can this be brought from outside the country ? will there be checking for this at the doha airport when you arrive from outside ?
re : is cipralex a controlled drug in qatar ?
they sell all of those group of drugs in the pharmacy , some you will need a local prescription for -LRB- available from a primary health doctor or specialist -RRB- but usually just buy over the counter . you are required to carry a medical certificate or copy of prescription when entering qatar in case you get checked but as long as you are just taking the medication for yourself and not trying to import it for others you will be ok . receiving medications of any kind by post is an absolute no . it is illegal and anything medicinal will be kept by customs -LRB- including a face mask i ordered from elemis but i did get it back . -RRB-
re : is cipralex a controlled drug in qatar ?
you 'll need a prescription for it . you can bring it in but make sure you have a note from your doctor saying that he prescribed it for you

aisha
i do not think so ... but u can apply for tourist visa for 1 month : -RRB-
visa extention
yes you can extend till another 3 months to complete 6 months as a total since she arrives in qatar .
the above information is not
the above information is not correct . 6 months visit visa is only for your direct relatives -LRB- blood relation -RRB- if its your wife 's relative then its only 3 months , and if you go request for 1 more month showing a ticket they might grant you .
it is correct . 3 mnths for
it is correct . 3 mnths for indirect relation and later a month extension after showing a ticket . go to the main immigration .
this not new rule it indeed
this not new rule it indeed old rules . niece or nephew is consider as direct relatives but sister in law is falls under indirect relatives of yours as she is the sister of your wife . @sms09 ... you are correct . ! anyhow you can still extend her visa of 1 month provided air ticket to the immigration officer , without ticket then sorry to say ... no extension . . note : if u r kabayan ... then pm me . . i will tell u best solution for that .

for ladies - husband visa . but for gents - wife visa applicable ?
dear all , i like to ask you a genuine query 1 -RRB- i know , ladies can work in qatar with husband visa . whether gents can work with wife visa ? thanks for comments in advance
re : for ladies - husband visa . but for gents - wife visa ...
according to new rule , it is possible i guss . .
re : for ladies - husband visa . but for gents - wife visa ...
according to the new rule , yes , it is <b> possible </b> . although still very complicated . does n't mean everyone automatically gets it . only ladies on the high positions/with high educational level can sponsor their husbands . also the nationality of the sponsor and sponsored husband is taken into consideration . and of course high salary level .
re : for ladies - husband visa . but for gents - wife visa ...
max123 , such a confident answer might mislead and disinform people . just curious , are you -LRB- or someone close to you -RRB- an hr specialist in immigration laws in qatar ?
re : for ladies - husband visa . but for gents - wife visa ...
old & new law both is applicable . good luck straight ahead toward immigration dept and apply .
re : for ladies - husband visa . but for gents - wife visa ...
<i> yes ... according to law , it is possible with the factor of your profession in your visa & salary range -LRB- above 7000 / - -RRB- . one other factor is the mood of the immigration personnel ... may allah help you with that ... : d
arriving in two weeks , should i bring my bycycle , or are ` new ' prices reasonable ?
as above i have a decent road / touring bike , i have read some of the threads regarding cycling . does anyone know how much airlines charge to bring a ` boxed ' bycycle , many thanks
re : arriving in two weeks , should i bring my bycycle , or ...
i was chatting to someone about cycling at the weekend . apparently i 've done the right thing shipping my bikes out as buying a decent brand new here will cost 2-3 times as much as elsewhere . best check with companies such as excess baggage company or other freight forwarders re shipping costs . most will send a bike boxed if you take the pedals and bars off . do n't go to the airline direct , you 'll get ripped off .
re : arriving in two weeks , should i bring my bycycle , or ...
better to bring your one , here its expensive ...
re : arriving in two weeks , should i bring my bycycle , or ...
nice bike with gears and stuff costs more then 1100 qar ...
re : arriving in two weeks , should i bring my bycycle , or ...
nothing here -LRB- no thing , not one single thing -RRB- here is logically priced . all retails deal with the thing on the basis of you are in qatar . you 're highly paid , you have to pay more !!!
re : arriving in two weeks , should i bring my bycycle , or ...
the price of nice cycle is 200 $ if you will pay extra weight jjust buy one from carefoure

aspire gym fees ?
ive been looking to sign up for a gym after ramadan . and i was wondering if anyone here knew how much they charged at aspire gym -LRB- women 's section -RRB- .

wow ! that 's not too bad at
wow ! that 's not too bad at all : o -RRB-
if you sign up for nine
if you sign up for nine months it 's even less . and they offer over 130 classes per week . mandi
hi dear
check your inboxx plzzx . .
the 150 qar per month
the 150 qar per month mentioned by a previous poster is the ` add-on ' price for using the gym . you have to also have paid for membership , which is 200 qar per month . so , it works out at 350 per month . i was there this morning making enquiries . they are not accepting any new members until after ramadan . membership begins at the first of the month , so that means new members will be accepted from 1st october . you can attend a class without being a member . there 's a charge of 50 qar per class . you ca n't do this with the gym though . they have spinning , pilates , circuit training , yoga , etc. they also do guided tours of the facilities on monday , but these wo n't resume until after ramadan . hope this helps .
mozzie , do you know what days
mozzie , do you know what days are pilates classes ?
aspire is terrible !
its very inconvenient and very expensive ... and they have no sense of customer satisfaction . i bought a membership and now during ramadan the swimming is at 9:30 at night !! who makes these stupid decisions !!
flanostu
it is permissible to swim during the day in ramadaan . muslims rinse thier mouth with water before prayer during fasting . there is not a single hadeeth that advice otherwise unless you 're making this up ; -RRB-
not making it up genesis . and
not making it up genesis . and to make matters worse , when i was living at ezdan the pool always mysteriously closed for cleaning during ramadan , so of course that just added fuel to my thoughts ... haha
mmyke
aspire active is a governmental sport institute meant for the local community in the first place . it 's expected that the timing is adjusted during ramadan to suit all . you can always join a hotel gym , you know ; -RRB-
and what does the `` community '' . .
include ? or rather exclude . ... and i do n't think people actually drink pool water ... just shows how far and illogical this is all taken . .

re : which is laptop is good ?
there are several considerations in buying laptops and here are some of the basics . . looks - definitely you want to have a laptop which can be mistakenly recognized as an old one , so you have to select which is the most updated and stylish in terms of appearance . right now , most laptops are getting thinner compared to their predecessors . also , a laptop which is small in terms of screen width -LRB- 14 inches below -RRB- is so stylish and more handy . any brand of laptop can be as stylish as is seems depending on your taste . battery life - this is also a major consideration in buying laptops . it also creates a lot of inconvenience if your laptop battery last for short periods only . in my experience hp laptop batteries are far better from any brand . just always remember that when you are charging your battery , unplug the cable once it is fully charged . if you are going to use your laptop for a longer period of time , it 's better if you plug the laptop to a regulated power supply and detach your battery from the laptop . the first two are basic considerations . below points are dependent on your applications the laptop shall be subjected once it is in operation . applications are graphic designs , web-designs , softwares , chatting , gaming , audio and video , emails and web-browsing , etc. . processor - buy laptop with a minimum of 2.0 ghz speed for better outputs of your applications . graphics - if you want good graphics , select a laptop with g-force in it . operating systems - vista and its predecessor , xp is really far from each other . although all new laptops are basically equipped with vista os , try on having two os 's like xp on one drive and vista on the other -LRB- dualboot -RRB- , so you can be more flexible . ram and hdd - random access memory -LRB- ram -RRB- and hard disk drive -LRB- hdd -RRB- are also to be considered if you want higher applications . anyway laptops right now are arriving at 2gb ram and 250 hdd at minimums . hope i 'd helped you on selecting a laptop . basically , we can not really say what laptop is the best ; it depends on your preferred application usage .

many thanks to all specially to lyndon_joseph . i suppose to buy dell xps 1530 .

ex ex
yes he is american , but he has asian roots and if you know your land well , you will know that the asians over in the west are know for having a `` savings account '' . so maybe he does not lead the `` extravagant '' lifestyle your family leads and $ 2000 may suffice for him for starters . imho , depending on where he worked , yes he could get more than $ 2000 in the us , but the problem over there is there is more supply than demand for the type of work he is looking for .
there is no harm in trying
you should put your ideas in action rather that talkingjust go to http://www.qf.org.qa/output/page19.asp http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/index.asp?cu_no=2&temp_type=44 there is no harm in trying
vegas
unfortunately there are a lot many job seekers who will come here for $ 2k / month . many of the asians see this as a stepping-stone for better prospects . besides , $ 2k for an asian is a lotta money .
not for an asian american colt
you seem to forget the chap says he is american . why would he come here for such a low salary ? as a stepping stone to $ 2500/month ? another low salary . this is very low by american standards from what i know .
yes , he 's just starting off and he has n't even got a degree
would n't it be better to tell him the truth and encourage him to get a degree , rather than chase low salary half-way around the world to a place that is more expensive than where he is ?
ex ex
i never told him to come 7000miles across here chasing a low-salaried job . i was the one to tell him the pay will not be more than $ 2k approx .
btw ex ex
whatever made you think he 's not getting a degree ?
his other thread colt .
he wanted to come here for a job at one of the universities he did n't get , said he did n't have a degree and inquired about whether it was necessary .
doc
we 're not fighting , we 're debating :-p ... btw , he has clearly mentioned in the post that he 's completing his bachelor 's degree in business administration -LRB- management information systems -RRB- from an accredited u.s. college . regarding his job , he said he almost got an it related help-desk job at carnegie mellon . i do n't know what happened to that one though : - -LRB-

hmm , not to be negative here but a young person just starting out with a newly minted degree may not have that much success here in the gulf . just my observation . mandi

rishi is correct on that one ... and that is what i have observed a lot in the gulf ... a eu / uk / us / au etc. passport will get you a better position with a better payscale in most companies in doha . another observation i made here is that , to be a secretary , you do n't need short-hand , nor do you need typing skills -LRB- min words / min etc. -RRB- as long as you 're under your husbands sonsorship , you can get a secretarial job .

hello guys , i about to finish my contract on june 30 -LRB- 2 years contract -RRB- and not planning to extend . my question is what letter should i give to my manager ? resignation letter or notice of non renewal of employment ? any format of letter would help .

letter of resignation means
letter of resignation means you do not want to finish the period of contract . then you may loose ur end of services . it is better to submit a letter stating that u do not want to renew the current contract . good luck
just do it ... ...
just make it nice and simple and keep it to a few lines which could also include i have had enough of working in your esteemed organization and will be moving on . if you ask them for a release letter , noc , etc then the waiting just gets longer and gives them another opportunity to play around with you and you can never be sure they will give you what you are requesting for .

you are under 18 means you are not supposed to be married yet !! how come you are already having a son !!!!! sounds strange .
for family sponsored visas ,
for family sponsored visas , you need to show proof that the sponsor and dependent have the same family names . this might require submission of the sponsors marriage certificate and the dependent 's birth certificate . otherwise pray that the officer who will handle your papers is kind enough to bend the rules in your favor .
longtimeresident
lool feed up ur mind ! . . its not my real age . . u should ask before u react . .
bring son birth certificate
just bring your sons birth certificate when applying for the visa .

re : is it legal in qatar for a company to hold an ...
it might seem illegal but the passport does n't serve its purpose even if it 's in your hands . should you need to exit or leave the country , your company still needs it in order to arrange for an exit permit . also , it 's better to let your company have it for safekeeping . there have been lots of stories or even appeals in the daily papers of people who have lost their passport while it was in their possession . in our company , passports are stored in a fire-proof safe . the staff have the option of either keeping the passports with them or letting the company keep it . majority prefer to keep it at the company 's safe , it also guarantees that the residence permits are renewed on time , as it is a common practice that it is renewed a week before its expiry .

which bank would you prefer to start an account ???
am living in doha ... i wish to start a bank account here . . please guide me about the documents needed to start an account ...
re : which bank would you prefer to start an account ???
ca n't say with authority but i would guess that it is best to open an account with a bank that has a presence in your own home town .
re : which bank would you prefer to start an account ???
to open an account you need salary certificate and iqama copy with id copy or passport copy . open an account with qiib or qib , if you take personnal loan or car loan . . there interest rate is very low compare to other banks . if you are looking for good service then go for qnb .
re : which bank would you prefer to start an account ???
i believe qnb has the best banking services , but perhaps not the most suitable interest rates or offers . you call any bank for required docuemtns to open an account .
re : which bank would you prefer to start an account ???
any bank will do
re : which bank would you prefer to start an account ???
it is better to open the account with those banks which has your company accounts . else , you will be charged for transferring salary on a monthly basis . ie ; suppose your company is holding an account with doha bank and you have opened an account with ahli bank , you will be charged qr .25 for salary transfer every month . the documents needed is your passport copies & your id copy
re : which bank would you prefer to start an account ???
i use both doha bank and mashreq bank ... doha bank is quite good in service when you want to remit your money to your home land . .
re : which bank would you prefer to start an account ???
soniya , money remittance is not the only service provided by banks ... i will never recommend doha bank ... the worst customer care ... i suggest qnb or ahli . .
re : which bank would you prefer to start an account ???
dear , without the company letter you can only open a saving account -LRB- with approx around qr500 as a starter deposit -RRB- . all the expat require a company letter to open a current account . please give a try to cbq -LRB- 2nd largest local bank in qatar -RRB- ... website www.cbq.com.qa and if you require help pm and will try to assist you .
re : which bank would you prefer to start an account ???
hsbc

new school times
what do parents think about the new school times due to more hours of arabic/islamic lessons in british curriculum run international schools ?
i think when u r in a islamic
i think when u r in a islamic country , one needs to learn the culture and their language too ?
so ?
so ?
parents will not mind if
parents will not mind if school increased the lessons of arabic/islamic but teachers are suffering coz they forgot to increase their salaries . in international schools all teachers are getting good salary except the arabic/islamic teachers , they get less than 30 % of the other teacher 's salary , simply no fair
yes you are right osama and i
yes you are right osama and i dont understand why arabic staff get paid less than other staff . it is baffling to me . some parents have complained at the new times , especially in the younger classes because the day is too long . no rizks , i want to know how most parents feel about the longer day for their children , due to the new compulsory increase in these subjects .
since when has the school day
since when has the school day got longer ??? not in our school !!!
my children do n't even have
my children do n't even have any arabic classes . the school only offers 1 second language choice in which i chose french . honestly i 'm a little disappointed they are not obliged to take arabic .
lost in qatar , i would not
lost in qatar , i would not worry ... very few children , even in schools where arabic classes are obligatory , actually learn arabic ... for various reasons .
those subjects were there in
those subjects were there in the 80 's in all the schools .
my kids learned arabic from
my kids learned arabic from their friends , because they spent a lot of time together at the beach and in the dunes ! it 's easy as that . in their school arabic was a must for arabs , but a choice for non-arabs .
coming from dubai , where it 's
coming from dubai , where it 's mandatory , surprised that it is not here . my children learned quite al ot in kg1 and grade 1 , they learned the alphabet , learned how to read and write . they did n't always understand what they were reading , nonetheless i was shocked on how much they had grasped the language . went back to canada for a year and now no arabic . i am seriously thinking of hiring a private arabic teacher . i 'm sure it would all come rushing back to them .
2 hours of arabic used to be
2 hours of arabic used to be obligatory to all arabic speaking children and 1 hour of islamic studies to muslim children . now they have introduced 4 hours of arabic to all arabic speaking children and non-arabic speaking children . 2hours of islamic and 2 hours of qatar history to all students . i have had mixed opinions so far from parents but heard quite a lot of negative ones . kids are absolutely shattered come 1 o'clock .
well , as to my experience , if
well , as to my experience , if you mix arabic and non arabic speakers who , obviously , are on totally different levels in the same class , things have to go down the drain . plus , the teaching methods of the arabic teachers and the other teachers are vastly different .
ah ok mt , it was different in
ah ok mt , it was different in the school my child used to go to .
what exactly are their school times now ?
7am-1 .30 am is my daughter 's timing and she attends one of the independant arabic schools . are these internantional schools actually going on for longer ? that would be very taxing !
it used to be 7.15 am -
it used to be 7.15 am - 12.15 pm for early years , 7am - 12.45 pm for ks1 and 7am - 1pm for ks2 . now its 7 - 12.30 for early years and started off 7am - 1.40 pm for ks1 & ks2 , now its 1.30 pm . big jump for the wee ones especially ks1
yes i would agree for the little ones
it must be tougher and i do n't believe it will reap much benefits as the kids will be prolly too pooped out to concentrate much on anything let alone grasp a new language . hope the teachers then make the classes as fun , captivating and creative as possible . . not to mention loud nuff to snap them outta their sleepy haze !

apartment comparison advice
hi guys . i am looking at 3 possible apartments to rent in : bilal studios al asmak y village al waab zig zag tower . anyone have any views on these places ? they are all similar prices but y village is 24 month contract , is this safe ? is there anything i need to watch out for or ensure i do when renting one of these properties ? thank you !
it also depends on the area
it also depends on the area you want to live in . it looks like all of them are in the opposite sides of the city . i personally eliminated bilal studios al asmak for the area reason . is it somewhere on a-ring road , correct ? i simply hate this area . zig zag sounds better in terms of area , but again i have heard so many negative responses regarding this place , that i can not advise on it . not familiar with y village . . is that a compound ? building ? who is the owner ?

i have not visited them yet no . i 'm moving over in 2 weeks and have viewings set up . y village seems to be my top pick at the moment . it 's developed by ramco , how are these guys to deal with ? the issue i have is the 24 month contract , it seems pretty restrictive . what if after 6/9 months i hate living there due to various issues ? bilal is on a ring , what 's wrong with this area ? thanks !

where is your office ? your
where is your office ? your options are in completely different sides of doha . if your office is in west bay , you better take zigzag tower , as you will spend at least 30-40 minutes coming from this y-village -LRB- still not sure where it is exactly , looks like new development , and sounds pretty far . -RRB- and going back there . do you need it ? i do n't like a-ring becuase this is old bad area . everything is old and ugly there . simple . you need to know where our office is .
qatarisun has a very good
qatarisun has a very good point . you should consider your work location . as for the duration of the contract , best to choose a place and then negotiate a deal you are most comfortable with . you do n't have to sign for 24 months but you may have to commit to at least a year . but you can try negotiating - you never know it might work .
the office is in west bay .
the office is in west bay . would it really take up to 40 mins to travel there ? that 's not ideal . i thunk i 'd like to live in a compound as i feel like there is a bit more freedom than a huge tower block . is there anything like that in westbay ? y village is n't even open yet as it is a new build . does anyone know of any similar apartments in close proximity to westbay for a max of 8k per month ? thanks !
in west bay no such prices
in west bay no such prices for compounds . not too many compunds there either . mostly towers ... only may be somewhere in golf club area , but it 's again pretty far . i think your best choice with your location and budget is either zigzag or ezdan . although both of them are not the best quality , as actually everything in qatar . at least you will be close to your office . by the way , i think in ezdan you can rent for short term , such as 1 or 2 month . and then you will have time to look around , and find somthing that you like .
hi , my names craig , i 'm the
hi , my names craig , i 'm the md of mirage properties . i 'd suggest you take a short term rent , say 1 month , to allow you to look around doha before committing to a long term contract . regards your choice of properties , we 've have been dealing with ramaco properties for a number of years and can tell you that the quality is good , y village , once opened , will be a great compound . however , the journey to your workplace would be at least 45 mins each way , as you could n't find a compound that 's much further from your workplace . i ca n't comment on bilal towers as we do n't deal with them but i hear the quality is good , but as most have said , the area is not the best . lagoon plaza or -LRB- zig zag -RRB- as they are known , has developed a bit of a poor reputation , mainly due to early problems with maintenance and the issue with district cooling -LRB- qatar cool -RRB- . although district cooling is common in the uae , it 's a fairly new concept here . it works well but is an additional utility cost on top of your electricity and water bills . zig zag is in a great location and will soon have a large mall and outdoor cafe/restaurant area -LRB- developer says will open in may but expect sept , after ramadan -RRB- we have apts available in zig zag within your budget and many landlords are prepared to negotiate on the qatar cool cost.as a rough guide qatar cool should cost just over qr5 per sq mt per month . as an example a 98sq mt 2 bed apt would cost around qr500 in total cooling charges , however some landlords will include the supply costs within the rent and leave the tenant to pay only the consumption charge , this being a small part of the overall cost , approx 10-15 % . i hope that helps and if you require further advice or wish to see a wider selection of properties please feel free to come back to me . by the way , unlike many other agents , we do n't charge you a fee for finding you a property ! kind regards craig at mirage

i 'm looking for a nursery for my 2.5 year old with down syndrome . ideally i would like her to be in an integrated environment with typically developing children at least for the preschool years . does anyone know of a nursery that would accept a child with special needs ? also , what schools accept children with special needs here in doha ? i 've heard of shafallah but thats hard to get into if youre not qatari .

can we make the best for all of ql ?
for a 4 yr old child and on ward : 1 . what is the school you recommend ? 2 . what is the advantage and disadvantage ? 3 . how much is the total yearly cost ? 4 . what are the main languages which are taught in the school ? 5 . what is your advice to overcome a problem you have faced with the school your son or daughter are studying in ?
could n't have said it better , nom
despite all the imperfections , the numerous schools and education centers in qatar offers us , locals and expats , who are contrasting and multifarious , one thing : choice .
your profile reads you are a
your profile reads you are a qatari , and you are asking us expats ?
first we have to know what
first we have to know what kind of education you want for your child . as frenchies said , values / educational needs may differ .
ok this is a tough one
1 . in all honesty i am not totally satisfied with the schools here , but since both my husband and i wish that our daughter should become fluent in arabic , we have her in an arabic independent or `` musthakhilla '' school . 2there are deffo plenty of cons but since she is now rapidly improving in her arabic , and doing good nuff in her subjects i will prefer to keep my complaints between the school staff and us . suffice to say i guess that no school can ever be perfect ! 3 . around 12,000 qr 4 . arabic and english only 5 . well i 'd say it 's always best to build up a good relationship with the school 's administration and always address them promptly when faced with any questions and concerns . this is crucial .
seriously , if sa wants to
seriously , if sa wants to know what is now , then this is it : 1 . no school can be recommended 2 . therefore this question becomes obsolete 3 . current fees are between qar 12.000 to qar 70.000 per year 4 . english and another language of choice -LRB- arabic , french , spanish , etc. -RRB- 5 . administration should involve parents much more . currently there is just a drop-off and pick-up service the parents are involved in . all together : the school system in qatar is stone-age and a shame for the so-called ` richest country in the world ' !
furthermore , subject teachers
furthermore , subject teachers should have at least a masters degree in their subject and should be continuously be trained ! that should , however , go hand-in-hand with an annual increase of salaries . as it is now , education is cheap in qatar . cheap in the sense of low quality . all there is are expensive buildings !
frenchies --
you are new here . i have been here 9 years now . for 9 years my children have attended a school where there are over 67 different nationalities . there are muslims , christians , buddhists , hindus and even jews there . they all exist in peace and mutual respect . what school ? - the american school of doha and no one has ever tried to indoctrinate my children into anything . all they have done is provide them with an excellent educational and a taught them global citizenship . do n't talk of what you do n't know please . our family values are still very much in tact .
yes , the asd . but how many
yes , the asd . but how many students can it accomodate ? 50.000 ? what about the poor ones ? what 's the fees again ? 60.000 or 70.000 all together ? so , we have one school in qatar . it 's occupied by children of oil company employees and a few sheikhs . what about the 90 % other children ??
schools indoctrinate ? which
schools indoctrinate ? which ones ? maybe the qur ` an schools .
ohhhhh no !!
they are going to get this thread whacked too ... poor brother straight arrow and his vision to make ql best for all . guys have pity on him and let him accomplish his mission . . please no religious arguments now !
1 . none 2 . same same 3 .
1 . none 2 . same same 3 . 20.000 to 70.000 4 . english 5 . leave qatar

all maersk staff sign a contract stating that they can never discuss nor reveal their pay not even to their colleagues as the remuneration is personal to holder - so you will not be getting anything . their hq is in denmark , the country with one of the highest income in the world . . the fresh graduate there earn 4k euro above . many of the staff come from their europe operation so i doubt that their pay is on the lower side

spiders , snakes and other creepy crawlies ??
hi everyone , being petrified of spiders and such like . i was wondering if you could tell me what kind of slightering slights and creepy crawlies are in qatar . especially doha area ! thanks songogga
big huge cockroaches . ew .

i totally agree with u , no creepier place in town infested like qube !!! the roaches n lizards are a welcome after tht place :p <span class="inline left"> <img class="image preview" src="/files/images/coollogo_com_882831935.preview.gif" alt="" width="237" height="58" /> </span>
geckos
i have geckos in the house occasionally but they are pretty cute . no roaches or ants especially if you throw food away properly , clean up spilt drinks and all the usual hygenie stuff . there is n't enough standing water for there to be too many mosquitos either .
said go to qube , heaps of creepy .
very true flano i had one lttle bastard follow my wife out and i had to politely tell him to get f@#&ked b4 he got the message ... ... . without imagination their is nothing !

britexpat
i love spiders , snakes and ants , specially when they harass the shit out britexpat ... <img src="http://logo.cafepress.com/8/2817834.5660348.jpg"> <img src="http://logo.cafepress.com/8/2817834.4555008.jpg">
doha reptiles
in doha the sighting of anything other than geckos is rare but will increase as urbanisation continues and the reptiles become familar with the new habitat . there are several excellent books on snakes of arabia , however , you are only likelty to see them if your adventurous and in the desert . a few venture into grassy areas but they are generally the harmless ones . scorpians are poorly research locally and here generally hide by day and are quite small so are hard to see . using a uv light at night is a good way to find them as they are flourescent !! pretty cool . again more liklely to see them in rural areas or on the beach . on spiders your likely to find a few harmeless fella around the house , but dont be to hasty to get risd of them as they keep the flying insects in check , same as gecko . in the desert the camel spider is a mean bugger if you get bitten but then you have to be pretty thick as their `` cave '' and web is pretty obvious .
we like camping and are
we like camping and are hoping to go camping in the desert ... would this be advisable with the scorpions etc ? gecko 's and lizards we can handle , in fact we have always wanted one inour house ! but anything with more than 4 legs ... yughh !
there are these massive
lizards , okay they are small . but one of them pooped in my kitchen jar . i killed it with broom stick . i shut another one in my door , by accident . but well it was more of good thing really .
any of ql members knows what is going on ??
i just heard this morning that cid is just checking on if somebody is making gathering and praying jesus , worshiping god or else . . they are also checking if any cars have any kind of stuffs related with religions . . if they found any such things they are directly deporting from the country . . is this true . . does any of you have heard about this ...

lots of comments from various frens . . but guys and gals . . this is true as lots of frens describe here also . . i also came to know from my frens that some of the qp senior staffs are also been deported . . so be careful ...
smoke . .
i commend you for your stand . how much do you want for the car ??
i 've seen alot of `` fishes '' on cars lately
wonder if that has anything to do with whats happening ???? `` your born , you live , you die , given this premise , one can conclude since we have no control over when we are born and when we die , the only thing that matters to us should be how we live , simple really ? '' mis-cat to her philosophy lecturer .
spreading the good news is a bad idea
like i said earlier , i heard that both christians and hindus had been deported , and that the reason given was that they were trying to convert others . i think everyone knows that non-muslim , monotheistic religion is tolerated in qatar , but within boundaries . for example , the churches have been told they may not erect crosses . it seems obvious that if the churches are n't allowed to display crosses , then it 's probably forbidden to display crosses , fishes or any other christian symbols on your car . i think most people also know that trying to convert people is a big problem here . apostasy for a muslim carries a death penalty , and encouraging a muslim to convert to another religion is both cruel and stupid . if a person makes a complaint to the police about religious activity it will probably be investigated . to avoid trouble , do n't carry religious literature around with you . do n't engage people in a conversation about your god unless you know they share the same faith . do n't discuss someone else 's god unless you know your audience wo n't be offended . for christians , especially evangelical ones , spreading the good news is part of their religious practice . that practice places people on a collision course with the local authorities . some people will take the risks on board , and continue to proselytize , but they have no reason to complain when they get kicked out of the country . it is unreasonable to sympathize with those who have been punished for proselytizing , when their activities are risking the lives of those they seek to convert .

be carefull
no
there is no such a thing happening in qatar because qatar is an islamic country and in islam its forbidden to block access of people for praying or worshiping there god regardless there religion

he probably does , gypsy ,
he probably does , gypsy , like everybody here does , too . but laws of physic also apply to him like to anything in the universe . so , be careful .
winn ... it goes back to the previous issue
if you allow a church to be built in qatar , then you pretty much have to assume that people are going to worship in it ... regardless of what the mullas say ... the emir allowed it ... <p> `` if you do n't like the heat ... get out of the kitchen ... but stop trying to fan the flames before you leave ... it will burn you on the a ** as you go through the doorway ...

bible study
apple , where i come from , bible study is performed by a group of people who study the bible literally as written , it has nothing to do with christianity , we call `` jehovah witnesses '' , they use the old testimony , do n't think that by attending that meeting , you will have an idea about christianity , its a sect , not a religion . they meet to read the bible , and explain it without going into spirituality and stuff ... their main objective is to attract you , they do not believe in jesus as we christians do . anyhow , i believe i went into too much details , its up to you to accept them or not . also , people are free in their believes , i do n't consider that we should express it through gadgets , or crosses , or ... just pray , and believe .
xena : i guess this is not
xena : i guess this is not about churches but more about prayer & meditation gatherings done by people of other faiths .
shiningstar
u meant vijay ?
hannud
jehovah witness are different from born again christians , the latter do believe in jesus . but they dont believe with popes , and the saints , and they dont believe in such kind of stone image of virgin mary or any saints , they dont even believe that jesus was the one in the picture with long beard and to my surprise they dont believe in christmas day was the birth of jesus ? at least that 's what i learnt meantime :-RRB- -RRB- jehovah witness ? am not sure , never attended yet to any of their gatherings ...
bible study
alot of these gatherings goin on in qatar . does it mean they have to be careful from the cid to get deported too ? p/s arien , its you who 's hijacking the thread my dear , were talking about religious gatherings in qatar , but you are talking about me :-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- lol !

you should do that anyways ,

true in parts
i 've heard from a reliable source that there have been recent deportations of both christians and hindus . the reason was proselytizing .
what ?
who care whom u worship inside your home ? but in the car ... hmmm i dont know ! anyways , i really doubt its for real ? lets hope its not .
most of my qatari friends go
most of my qatari friends go to `` churches '' . there they have parties with alcohol and whores from bahrain and marocco . funny that they call these guesthouses `` churches '' .
i see ... xena
maybe in such a case they will deport people , but if someone just practice their own religion in their own home/privacy , why to deport ? they can not expect to hired all muslims ? like in my case , there are some born again friends who tried to invite me for a so called bible studies . i told them i 'm cool with that coz it does n't cause me any harm and i 'd like to understand their beliefs . but next time i 'm inviting them in my religion too to understand mine . why ca n't we just live and let live ?

your comment is not for me , apologies for this . but i think its just like hanging a small qur ` an or a `` mishba '' in our car , we felt protected . its part of their belief .
lol ! arien
ahh hmmm wait ... let me check mr. webster ; -RRB-
nicaq25
i 'm not sure with others , but if you ask me as a muslim ? ... sure i can relate with you guys . i still feel its very injustice to deport anyone due to religious belief unless he/she tried to convert any muslim in that country coz just like ngourly said , he/she will put someone 's lives at risk by doing that . though , personally i have no problem w / someone preaching and trying to convert me coz i have my own faith which is strong in i believe . so long the person who preaches me wont stop me from practicing my own belief , then i 'm cool with that .
personally , i do n't believe in conversion
because there are factors that makes me skeptical of the people convincing me . i 'd rather more likely to be convinced on the testimony of one person 's life.that is practicing your faith in your daily life . for me by just reading the bible literally , does n't make me see god . but i can see & feel god through people , ordinary people . i think that 's the real essence of being christian or being one that believes there is only one god , one creator.he maybe called in many names depends on which part of the universe we are , but i guess he is still the one .

i was serious to answer you too . i am putting a small qur ` an in my car because of its content . in my belief some aya 's and doa'a in it will able to help me shoo away shaytan and be safe travelling . do u mean i should n't believe it or does it makes me shirk ? kindly enlightened me ? tnx : -RRB-

ok , so i am trying to get a definative answer . you said you keep it in the car to protect you , then you said you keep it because there are some ayas and duas to read to keep you safe . you said you keep it because you cant remember these ayas and duas , so logically to use them to keep you safe while driving you would have to be reading them right ? means i still have got no clear answer why this protects you in the car . ____________________________________________________ `` diplomacy is the art of saying ` nice doggie ' until you can find a rock - will rogers ''

getting car lisence after 2012 or 13
after 2012 or 2013 we can only get car lisence in qatar if we are over 21 . is this true . .
it will be a good idea , if
it will be a good idea , if implemented but i will personally suggest it should be 22 yrs . i have seen very young drivers driving land cruisers like a plane and they think like the others are like ants on the road .
the gossip we are hearing
the gossip we are hearing from almost 1 years . but it 's not so strong idea . because the young people will drive without license if they not provide at 18 years age . than it will be more problem for them as well as for us . better give them correct driving skills so that they will be careful as well as all of us . most of the reckless driver -LRB- young -RRB- you see on the road are having license after 1/2 or more years their driving without license !!!
it has nothing to do with age !
the only thing that can stop these reckless drivers is more radars and to increase the number of black points to 5 or 6 when they exceed the limit set on the particular street .
do not forget higher fines
do not forget higher fines for traffic violations . the one thing that seems to open their eyes is a heavy drain on their pocket books
confiscate the car ...
hope there was some system to confiscate the car of the reckless driver , and should be given a smaller car to drive for some days ... even i wondered how it would be if some policemen are deployed to survey the road -LRB- drive thru a strech of road -RRB- along with cameras , in smaller civilian cars to see and catch the culprits easily !

is there any hospital without english medicine to get treatment for leg broken ?
my friend has a problem with leg broken . first he got the treatment in the hospital with english medicine . but that is not success . so , please let me know any hospital or individual doctor treatment without english medicine .
re : is there any hospital without english medicine to get ...
how can u class the medicine as english specifically ? hmm next time i go for medical treatment i 'll look for a little union jack on the bottle ... or even wait for it to start speaking in englihs to me :-p no seriously , tried visitng a quack at all?that ; 's the only alternative no ?
re : is there any hospital without english medicine to get ...
i dont think french medicine or italian medicine is available ... !!! hehe
re : is there any hospital without english medicine to get ...
are you asking about homeopathy , ayurveda , cupping ... etc. ... you may find cupping therapy , but it wont heal a broken/fractured leg ... the others are not available . may be you could explain your question better to get the right response .
re : is there any hospital without english medicine to get ...
i guess he is looking for the ayurvedic treatment for the broken leg , i am not sure weather you can find a ayurvedic doctor here . i didnt see your profile and i dont know what nationality you are , any how back in sri lanka there are so many ayurvedic doctors for fracture related treatments . its quite unbeleivalbe the power of herbs . i my self fractured my leg and it was treated by an ayurvediv doctor . recently my son all of sudden who started limping and we found out that one of his legs is longer than the other and tried with many doctors -LRB- we call it english medicine there -RRB- and many xrays , mri 's and tests and so on but no body could even diagnose the problem . then it was ayurvedic treatment , the aw dr said it will take some time and your son has to be admitted in my hospital i agreed and we stayed exactly on month . again the miracle of herbs with gods willing he was cured and he is perfectly alright now . sorry it must be boaring , any how its magic of ayurvedic medicines

short course on basics of photography ?
do you know someone who is offering a short course on basics of photography ?
re : short course on basics of photography ?
join a group of photography enthusiast and you 'll be able to learn not just basic course ... try this ... http://www.qatarliving.com/group/qatar-living-photography
re : short course on basics of photography ?
education . . if you find one , please let me know . . my husband and i would love to join !!
re : short course on basics of photography ?
i really need to start charging for my courses - i could make a fortune ! ql have a regular informal get together every second tuesday where we take pictures and chat about photography . last week i gave a small group a lesson on the basics . i suggest as a start point you join the ql photography group and search through it 's topics as there are some good links to photo basics there . click here : http://www.qatarliving.com/group/qatar-living-photography and on particular , click here : http://www.qatarliving.com/node/226360
re : short course on basics of photography ?
well ... all i can say is photography is all about creativeness and a few camera parameters to keep yourself well aware of . i bought my first canon powershot sx100 is and shot a few really amazing photos just by reading the manual . most people who are unable to use a gadget properly are either sick of reading manuals or careless enough to use it in `` auto '' mode . a camera has 4 main parameters to adjust while taking pictures of subjects in different light and movement conditions , viz : shutter speed , iso , exposure time and aperture value . read about how these parameters work together on the internet and you 'd know how close you 're to becoming a photographer . joining a course to master the skills sound ridiculous to me . the choice is yours anyway . cheers !
plasma or lcd ?
lcd or plasma tv ? i beleive plasma is better for cable and sat tv ? there is a good samsound 42inch plasma in carrefour , lulu and virigin . series 4 42a410 i think it is . qr3979 good buy ?
re : plasma or lcd ?
buy philips , sony , hitachi , panasonic but do not buy samsung . samsung tvs will not support you for more than 1 and half 2 years . i do agree , nothing matches the picture quality but it is good if you are planing the tv for a short term .
re : plasma or lcd ?
if you 're in the market for a big screen television like 50 50-inches and above -- then i 'd suggest plasma as a safe bet . plasmas give you more bang for your buck at the big end of town , and while lcds can give you better resolution , plasma still has the edge in terms of picture quality . one other thing to look for , whether you opt for plasma or lcd , is an integrated tuner -- many tvs still have analogue tuners , which look pretty terrible on a large screen . try to get a model with an inbuilt hd tuner if you can . at the smaller end of things -LRB- 15 '' to 42 '' tvs -RRB- , lcd is the only way to go if you want something slim and tasteful .
re : plasma or lcd ?
i would go for lcd
re : plasma or lcd ?
lcd hands down . in almost everyway , lcd wins , it is superior . if movies look bad on satellite , it the decoders fault . you might also look into not using composite cables as they make it useless to own a hd tv . use vga , dvi or hdmi . using a component cable for a hd tv , is worse than buying a ferarri , without any gas . yes its that pointless .
re : plasma or lcd ?
lcd is a better choice .
re : plasma or lcd ?
i go for plasma . unless you will be using the blue ray or blu ray recorded then you may able to watch the most cosmetized picture of all . lcd may give you the clearest picture of all but as far as true color realism is concern for me plasma is the best .
laptop problem
guys , the cd-rom drive of my laptop makes a ot of sound . what should i do ???
re : laptop problem
first try to insert different cd and check if it will give sound . if it does , try to remove your cd rom from your laptop to check it . try to clean it as well using the cd-rom cleaner disk .
re : laptop problem
careless user that 's why sound 's coming ... ... ... . . if u have warranty card why u dont bring ur laptop to the service center stated at the warranty card.to check when the sounds come .
re : laptop problem
mostly the cd-rom makes sound when its corrupted or when you put a corrupted cd inside . so please try to change the cd and see how it is . . if the laptop is underwarrnty then please take to service center and get it fixed . its really tough to replace the cd-rom drive if its not under warranty as its internal part and tough to find the replacement with same size . .
re : laptop problem
what is the model of your laptop ? if your cd-rom can detach from your laptop . . do it . but remember to turn off your laptop first before you do that . . after you detach it from you laptop . open your laptop . then turn off again . put back the cd-rom . it works to me . . try it . good luck !
re : laptop problem
does it make noise all the time or just with a certain cd ?

job offer in cambridge school
hi everyone , i recently got a job offer in the cambridge school and i need a feedback about that college : the environment , the ambiance , how do they treat their stuff , the salaries ... i really need your advices . i 'll be thankful . does anyone work there ?
you have n't stated is it the
you have n't stated is it the international school or girl 's school however both do n't have a good reputation especially the girl 's school . they are not good to their staff , have loads of after school meetings that are n't productive and a waste of time . teacher 's could use that time more productively for class prep etc.salary depends on your nationality . if i were you i would n't accept a position their !
i was a student at cambridge
i was a student at cambridge until 2009 and dunno how the situation is now but i can honestly say it was one of the worst schools at that time the student behavior is horrible . so horrible that they had to bring in like 10 security guards and put in cameras all over the school the teachers were mostly indian with a couple of english in high ranking positions but head of security -LRB- an arabic lady -RRB- was basically ruling the school.even the teachers were scared of her . this is obviously a students perspective from two years ago so dont take it too seriously if i had to list all it 's faults the character limit will be passed
u r treated like a slave
u r treated like a slave der , u have loads of work plus u dont get any dignity der.cisg , tcs and dmis are run by poor management.u can be thrown and put any were , any place and they make maximum use of you.so be careful before accepting any offers from dem
thank you all for your
thank you all for your advices ... you scared me actually ! i thought that it was a good school since it 's `` cambridge '' !! it 's surprising that most of the stuff are indians ...
do not go there , a close
do not go there , a close friend of mine works there so i get all of the stories all bad ones , the indian regime , the attitude is horrible , if you have been offered a job there then you are highly likley to be offered somewhere else , the cheapest possible air fare home routing through dubai overnight , the delayed salary in july , paid in september so you will return etc , etc , etc
there are a lot of schools
there are a lot of schools who use words like `` cambridge '' `` oxford '' `` american '' `` british '' `` international '' i can open a school called the international new york school for fine arts and none of those words have any relationship to the type of school i operate . good for you for asking here first .

salam iq755 , send an official letter requesting them to issue an noc letters to apply for family visit visa under your sponsorship and to exempt him from two-year ban -LRB- in case your brother was employed less than 2 years -RRB- . attached your passport and rp copies ; and so his passport and rp cancellatin page copies . further , there is no harm if he will be backed here for visit or work or whatever legitimate purpose he intents . it 's a basic human right to earn his living or conduct his private legal business . no one can bar you from that so just be honest with his previous employer to avoid a can of worms . knowing technip , i do n't think they will hold any issue against your brother for his visit or work again here in qatar unless your brother has a lingering bad reputation . hope the above helps .

i wan na know
hello every body here , is here in doha any diplomatic office or consulate for australia ? because i wan na apply for visa to go there this year , thanks
as far as i know
you can apply online for a visit visa , for any nationality . in fact , all nationalities now have to have a visa prior to entry . used to be ok for commonwealth , then they changed it to only new zealand , and now , even the kiwi 's need a visa . i can tell you , whatever you do , dont try to take food in , as they are extremely strict . another trick to avoid huge delay 's at the airport is to declare something . that way , they are happy , and will , relatively speaking , leave you alone . if you dont declare things , and get picked out for inspection , you will be there for ages . love my country , but it is a total pain travelling to and fro , even as a citizen . and , qatar does not have an embassy or consul here . you need to go to the near useless embassy in abu dhabi , uae . three times i have tried to get very simple things done , and all three times failed .
i would love to visit

will pregnancy affect employment offer
my friend 's wife will receive a job offer from a government office in another 4 -5 days.today they came to know that the lady is 1 month pregnant.will this affect her employment offer and what about the medicals prior to joining job too .
depends on the company . but
depends on the company . but i doubt if the offer will go through .
lp
whats the comparison between pregnant women and idiots ??? lol : -RRB-
speaking as a pregnant woman ,
speaking as a pregnant woman , sometimes we can be idiots . around the third trimester you 'd forget your own head if it was n't attached to you .
i think its not a problem ,
i think its not a problem , but she will not be elgible for meternity leave before one yr ...
normally pregnancy is not
normally pregnancy is not looked as a hindrance . esp in the govt sector here in doha . but better to mention orally before the tests go through . honesty never fails !
looking at it from an hr
looking at it from an hr point of view , she 's not a good investment . first of all she 'll have to take quite a bit of time off in her first 9 months -LRB- for doctors appts . sick leave , etc -RRB- as well as 54 days of maternity leave , and the likely hood of her coming back to work is slim . i would n't hire her .
as per experience , yes it
as per experience , yes it will surely affects her job offer . i am one of the recruitment officer in one of the govt offices before , and its one of the policy that they ca n't hire a pregnant women even in some govt & private offices that i 've known . their reasons : 1st , they will thought that you will be going to file your long day leave upon delivery or often to file a leave during pregnancy . 2nd , they will probably thought that you can not exert ur best effort in doing your job because usually pregnant women feels so many body changes , body pains etc , and sometimes some superior are hesitant to give work load to their staff if she is pregnant . 3rd : ur medical results will be stamped as unfit to work if found out that your pregnant ... so the best thing , if your planning to look for work , dont get pregnant , but you can get pregnant if you already hired or started to work -LRB- bec . that 's 2 different case -RRB- ...
even with the smiley face
even with the smiley face that is harsh prism :-p , not true for many many pregnant women , but mm is right too . anyway , even while being pregnant and hormonally on a roller coaster , pregnant women can be extremely active and bring good results on the work front . coming to the op , if the medical is already over , then nothing really to worry about , except probation may go longer , once they know the employee is pregnant . if medical is not complete yet , and if the candidate is really required by the company , then a temporary job offer may be presented to her , and only when she returns back from her maternity leave , will her job become permanent . it all depends upon their hr policies .
will pregnancy affect employment offer
agreed with arlene advised , its all country ruling not to hire pregnant unless nobodies qualified for the post in the country or the applicant is a scientest .
i wish her all the best ,
i wish her all the best ,
han19 ... i didnt mean to be
han19 ... i didnt mean to be harsh ... just stated reality from a corporates pov ... for idiots i think there is no issue ... for pregnant women coming on board afresh , other women have already elaborated on it ... and smiley was just to soften the pinch of reality ... :-RRB- but still if it sounds harsh my apologies to whomever it may concern , as it was unintentional .
if she receives a job offer
if she receives a job offer letter and later gets turned away , then she may file a claim for discrimination . i do n't know if that can go anywhere in this legal system . but if she gets hired , her employer will have the right of putting her under unpaid leave , during the 50-day maternity leave period . for more details , read art. 96 of the labour law -LRB- see below -RRB- `` a female worker who has been employed by an employer for a complete year shall be entitled to maternity leave with full pay for a period of fifty days . such maternity leave shall include the period before and after the delivery provided that the period following the delivery shall not be less than thirty five days . ''
2012 olympics , i have worked
2012 olympics , i have worked as a recruiter for over 14 years and i can witness how women can be far more productive during their pregnancy .
maybe they can . but your
maybe they can . but your view is not the view of most employers here .
in my similar yrs of working
in my similar yrs of working under , along side and in supervising capacity didnt see or hear anyone of them being as productive when they were not pregnant ... the toughest ones were those who had the hobby of getting pregnant -LRB- every year -RRB- ... finding someone to delegate for them used to be a big challenge for understandable reasons .
well , 2012 olympics , the way
well , 2012 olympics , the way you wrote your previous comment made it looked more like your own perspective as an employer . testing an applicant for pregnancy is nothing but an act of discrimination . i can not argue whether is legal or not in this country , but is just my humble opinion on this particular issue . prism , i know what you 're talking about , but it 's a matter of education and culture and companies would need to enforce a strict recruitment control , ensuring that all applicants go through proper channels and procedures . we all suffer the same not only from pregnant women but also from male slackers who will keep calling-in sick almost every sunday or thursday for no apparent reason .
after the medical check-up
after the medical check-up they will inform to the employer and it 's the employer decision . if the employer is ok with that , they have no problem to accept you and process your papers

traffic viloation .
i have a traffic violation and i need to travel for a business meeting . do i need to pay it before applying for an exit permit or it is ok i will just pay it once i will renew my car registration ? thanks
re : traffic viloation .
i did the same , after i came back from vacation and went in for renewal of car registration i had to pay a penalty for paying the fine late , i had to pay some sixty riyals extra other than the fine which was five hundred , so better sort it out as quick as u can , good luck
re : traffic viloation .
thanks for your reply ... i had a stupid violation `` i didnt turn my light on in cornich at night '' and when i was caught the police told me of a 300 qar fine but when i checked it online , it was 1000 qar . some guys said i can asked the police to change the fine but i dont have much time and i dont know where to go so i just leave it . now i am charged 1000 qar . will this give me any problem to get my exit permit ?
re : traffic viloation .
if you are thinking of challenging this fine then , wait until you comeback from your trip . otherwise it take only a few minutes to pay the traffic fine , please settle the fine before travel and be free for all worries .
re : traffic viloation .
if it is the red signal jumping -LRB- qr . 6000 -RRB- it is better to pay and visit . otherwise , for smaller amounts , they will allow you to go out of airport , you may pay later

need your advice on kahramaa
i am in the process of shifting between two apartments from two different landlords . this means i 'll need to terminate the kahramaa contract for the old apartment and start a new one , is this something you can do in a single step process ? if you have done this before , what is the best way of doing it ?
i dont think it is a single
i dont think it is a single step process . your new apartment will have a meter and a number given by kahrmaa . you will need to have that no when u go to kahrmaa and also the receipt which was given to you when you paid the adv for the current house . you will ofcourse have to fill out the transfer form and they will make the transfer . but you need to let them know when you are shifting so that they can give you the connection before you shift . i guess thats about it . its all i did when i shifted but that was in 2006 . i doubt if much has changed but here you never know . also have copies of your rp , passport and id and a fotograph just in case and a copy of your new lease agreement .
find kahrama office service depending on you area . .
find kahrama office service depending on you area . . you need to cancel the first contract and the initiate new one . . not two birds in one shot . . cancellation procedures : 1 - take photo of the meter reading of electrisity and water both . . 2-fill up the form of cancellation 3 - copies of your identity cards 4-copy of your tenancy contract 5-copy of gurantee slip -LRB- 2000 -RRB- qr then they will calculate your balance and issue check qnb or you have to pay in case your previous payments exceeds the limit of 2000 qr advanced , next step initiate new account ... same procedure when you applied first time ... goodluck :-RRB- -RRB-
wish you all the luck !!! you

i am not sure of moving
i am not sure of moving within two apts . but disconnecting and getting my refund took me not more than an hour ... as was advised went early in the morning to kharama office ... the technician came along as i was the first customer , took the reading , went back to there office , he uploaded the details and gave me a print which i carried to one of the officers for his signature and then to the cash counter , got my money ... everything happened as smoothly as it can be .

ok everything was handled in
ok everything was handled in 30 minutes . went to the musheireb branch at 6:45 am , a gentleman took all my paperwork including pictures of the old apartment 's readings , so no need to call for a technician ! they made an estimation for the final settlement , got reimbursed with the difference and then had to reopen a new account and paid a new deposit of 2100 qr . it was very easy , all thanks to mr. hamad from the main counter .

my wife is going to deliver our first baby here in qatar , but we dont know that what will be the formalities for baby 's birth certificate , visa and passport and how long will it take to prepare these documents ? please suggest and share your experiences .
re : what are the government formalities here after baby 's ...
dear , first decide very well what name you shall give ? after birth take father and mother passprot copy and marriage certificate . if born in hamad hospital it is quiet easy . if not -LRB- doha / al ahalia clinic then get birth notification from the hospital -RRB- and go to the birth registration office -LRB- next to lulu center , opp hamad clinic -RRB- and produce the letter in ground floor reception along with marriage certificate , parents passport and rp copy . by the time you can also get child vacination card . after that they will ask you to go to third floor . the will ask father and mother rp and qualification certificate . give it in 3rd floor and pay in ground floor . according to number of copies you will pay . after a week you can collect it.later take it to embassy and get birth certificate from them and apply for passport . after getting passport you can also apply and get rp .
re : what are the government formalities here after baby 's ...
dear sir , first tell me ? what is your nationality , call me i will help you , call 6550792 i will prepare all necessary documentation for your baby pp and visa also need services please call .
re : what are the government formalities here after baby 's ...
read this http://www.qatarliving.com/node/270116
re : what are the government formalities here after baby 's ...
when they discharge your wife , they give u a list of docoments which are necesary for birth certificate , so apply for b.c asap , after receiving birth certificate go to your embassy for passport , when u get child 's p.p then just pay fee and enroll or registered him/her name for visa , try to do all these steps during 90 days , after 90 days they 'll fine you for late registration
re : what are the government formalities here after baby 's ...
the hospital will advise you for birth certificate , take 2-4 additional copies of birth certificate , it will be available for additional payment of qr . 20 / - for each . approach your embassy for making passport for your expected baby . apply for residence permit original passport one photograph of your baby original birth certificate copy of blood group certificate father & mother rp copy . pls . make sure you have to apply within two months , after birth , for the residence permit , otherwise there will be a fine of qr . 10 / - per day of delay .
re : what are the government formalities here after baby 's ...
i advice u to contact your embassy what are the procedures , but anyway in our office once they give birth they have to come to our office to register the new birth , after registration of birth they have to apply a new passport for thier child in order to obtain an rp in doha . have a good day !

gender friendly hotels
can anyone help me find a hotel in doha that both genders can share a hotel room -LRB- without a marriage certificate -RRB- ?
re : gender friendly hotels

with the grace of allah almighty qatar is a muslim country . therefore you need to respect the islamic values .
re : gender friendly hotels

re : gender friendly hotels
why in the world would you wan na share an hotel room with some one who is not marry to you ??
re : gender friendly hotels
unfortunatly my wife forgot it back in the u.k , we are both here now spending extra money on 2 rooms . im looking for a way to spend time with my wife without flying all the way back just for a peice of paper
re : gender friendly hotels
just book it in one of your names , and then later have the other person jump on the elevator and join you upstairs . be discreet , take precautions , but it can be done . if you 're caught/confronted , claim you 're married and that you just do n't have the paperwork on hand to prove it . be outraged and indignant ... especially if you 're both western , this usually works . they really only care if one of you is asian/arab , or if as a couple you 're being really overt and in your face about things , lots of pda 's etc. . loads of guys here -LRB- locals and expats -RRB- book hotel rooms and manage to use them with a prostitute or with their regular girlfriend ... good luck !
re : gender friendly hotels
have someone back home scan your marriage certificate and e-mail it to you . do a good job in color and it likely wo n't be questioned . just print it off and only show it if specirically asked to ...
which is the best 4wd ?
which is the best 4wd -LRB- 2nd hand -RRB- to buy between price range 60,000-70 ,000 qr ??
re : which is the best 4wd ?
land cruiser or prado
re : which is the best 4wd ?
the one i have
re : which is the best 4wd ?
prado v6 , the other one sucks .
re : which is the best 4wd ?
xterra offroad !!!
re : which is the best 4wd ?
will you use it for dune bashing ? or just for city road like those `` never been offroad '' 4wd users :-RRB- for dune bashing : land cruiser , patrol , pajero , pathfinder , cherokee classic , etc. .
re : which is the best 4wd ?
if you budget is 60,000-70 ,000 then better go for pajero , as you can get a good condition pajero 2007-2008 model . but if you are planning for sand dunes , then pajero is not an ideal car . you have to look for land cruiser or patrol .
re : which is the best 4wd ?
4wheel drive for what purpose ? if you want to use for daily commuting , all 4wd are goood . all depends on your budget . for serious off-roading , go for jeep wrangler . if you are looking for just size and comfort , better you should look for after sale support , ease of spare availability , easy to maintain and easy to sell . in this catagory only toyota and nissan would be best choice .

living with my wife with different sponsors ?
my wife is coming to qatar on another sponsor and we intend to be living together . what are the steps i need to take to achieve this legally ? please i need qatalivers advice . thanks
the only time i have heard of issues with husbands and
wives being on seperate sponsors , is when the wife was on family sponsorship , ie , her fathers - when the kids were born immigration asked for the wife 's sponsorship to be transfered to the husband .
yes , why not ? sponsors
yes , why not ? sponsors does n't matter as long as you are married . you should be having proper marriage certificate just in case . but most of the married couples here if working are with different sponsors . not a problem at all .
no steps needed . . just have your marriage cert available .
and you can live together .
make sure that you marriage
make sure that you marriage certificate verified with your embassy ... then noooo probz ... u can stay together . .
thanks all

tire shops got it , suggest you buy yourself an instrument to measure the pressure yourself -LRB- cost from 35 rials -RRB- and if you buy yourself a compressor you are self sufficient .

woqood patrol & service station , you can check the tyre pressure , all the simple services

resident permit
my son will turn 23 years old by next month , he is currently under my sponsorship as family visit visa . is he eligible to get residence permit or is it allowed to renew his visa before it will expire -LRB- on 6 months visit visa -RRB- ? what are the procedures to obtain if applicable to any of the two type mentioned .
re : resident permit
a visit visa is valid only for 6 months . it is rare to get an extention more than that . and as to a rp your son is over 18 and you will not be able to sponsor him . the only way to keep him here on an rp is for him to be sponsored by a company .
re : resident permit
. if your son is a student you can get the renewal by submitting student certificates from the university concerned . try it if applicable .
re : resident permit
he needs to find a job n get visa from the company and will get work permit

wanted to apply schengen visa going to sweden . . no embassy in qatar
hi anyone experienced traveling going to sweden ? where did you apply for the visa ? i have n't got insurance , is it necessary in the supporting documents ?
re : wanted to apply schengen visa going to sweden . . no ...
hi , i believe all schengen visa applications are dealt with via the german embassy in doha . probably best to check their website for further details . best of luck .
re : wanted to apply schengen visa going to sweden . . no ...
i think swedish embassy is in kuwait . there was a thread in ql earlier in 2010 regareding this issue -LRB- do a search -RRB- . you may call and ask them or you may check with the embassies of other schengen countries -LRB- france , germany etc. -RRB- for further details . i dont think you need insurance documents for applying the visa .
re : wanted to apply schengen visa going to sweden . . no ...
you can apply for schengen visa through any other schengen countries -LRB- france , germany - pretty much all of the eu countries -RRB- although apparently they all have different rules , so look around . i assume you will be catching a flight through another eu country anyways , so just have to have a stop over probably . good luck !
re : wanted to apply schengen visa going to sweden . . no ...
no need of having swiss embassy to get shengen visa . you can use services of german embassy to get this . it is in bin omran ... opposit side of ahli hospital , , the road near salaam ho . -LRB- i dont know they changed location -RRB-
my wife is not consuming?can any body suggest better hospital for checkup
my wife in not consuming from 8 months , can any body suggest better hospital for check up .
re : my wife is not consuming?can any body suggest better ...
8 months is not tooo much i think ... but anyway u can consult a doctor , i suggest dr.khudsiya beegum , alwaab street -LRB- khalifa stadium -RRB- you need to go there to get register for first time , the clinc timings are 8:00 am to 12:00 noon then from 16:00 to 20:00 from surterday to thursday . contact : 44475969
re : my wife is not consuming?can any body suggest better ...
if you are taking alcohol or tobacco , cut down . get yourself free from any stress . winter is coming . do not loose hope .
re : my wife is not consuming?can any body suggest better ...
i advice to go to hamad hospital ... as khudsia begum is not the best doctor . just this site makes good advertising for her ... being in emergency situation i did not get any help from her ... just was re-directed to hamad ... but their money they take accurately . so i do not trust any private hospitals . for the money they charge at dr. khudsia 's clinics they could at least provide the tissues and soap in ladys ' wc ...
re : my wife is not consuming?can any body suggest better ...
you need basic investigations that can be done with any gynaec dr.even dr.beegum is ok for that .

re : lexus is 300/gs 300 or bmw 5 series or merc benz e class
suggest you go for the mercedes c - class instead of e class -LRB- which will be replaced next year -RRB- get one with a propre engine and as many options you can afford and you will not go wrong . trust me !!

re : lexus is 300/gs 300 or bmw 5 series or merc benz e class
worry about walet ?? then go straight away to is300 , or even is350 , and think about es350 , great preformance , reasonable luxury , and good price at resale , bmw5 is a bit pricy , benz e r going to be changed next year , c class is small ,

can anyone give me idea
about the cost of living for family with two schl going children in alin -LRB- uae -RRB- near abudhabi.thanks in advance for your best inputs .
re : can anyone give me idea
are u asking about cost in al ain -LSB- abu dhabi -RSB- then why u have posted in qatar . . qatar is a country , nothing to do with uae . plz , review ur question
re : can anyone give me idea
dear friend , i have lived in uae for more than 12 years and an year back only shifted to doha , qatar . of all the 7 emirates , in terms of house rents , abu dhabi is considered to be the most expensive but al ain being less populated , the price you pay for a two bedroom ordinary flat , you may get a 3 bedroom villa in al ain.that too , due to recession effect , the prices are expected to be slashed . the schools are also easy to get admission due to the same reason of less populated area . a quite place but you will get easy access to all basic amenities , like shops , taxi stands . even the taxi fare is comparatively less than other emirates esp dubai . hope this information was useful to you . if i come across some more significant info , will definitely post it or will pm you . regards ,
re : can anyone give me idea
i think qatar is the best 4 u. we have best schools in here.and leave uae

how is tap water ?
is the tap water here inside houses fit for drinking ? do we need to buy water cans ?
re : how is tap water ?
not fit for drinking . use bottled water instead .
re : how is tap water ?

re : how is tap water ?
comparing to bottled water tap water is good in quality analysis . what really make difference is cleanliness . if your storage is clean and using filter , then tap water is the better .
re : how is tap water ?
i 'm drinking tap water for years ...
re : how is tap water ?
there were many articles before on ql whether the bottled waters are fit for drinking or not . . all bottled waters r not safe for drinking coz of high sodium content which is harmful for human health in long run ... people are installing ro -LRB- reverse osmosis -RRB- at their home that filters tap water which one can drink straight away ... please go through the links below for detail . http://www.qatarliving.com/node/1206080 http://www.qatarliving.com/node/1206095 http://www.qatarliving.com/node/1227920 http://www.qatarliving.com/search?cx=008937172676595728955:066rihafv68&cof=forid:11&q=bottled+water&sa=search#1564

thanks for the info
thanks for the info amoud , , is it really so ? howabout going thru the consultancy office ?
does n't matter what you are
does n't matter what you are going through ! canada immigration officer does n't care about it . he/she is strictly following the procedure , rules and instructions . and by the way this is the first thing you guys have to learn about canada . you have to be loyal and law obedient and rules respectful . no fooling around , no playing games , no middle-eastern tricks and focus-pocuses ! if you have gained enough points on six factors , you become eligible to apply for the immigration . it doesnt make you a permanent resident automatically though . <i> <b> ********************* you become responsible forever for what you have tamed . antoine de saint-exupry </b> </i> <img src="http://cdnll.img1.imagechef.com/w/080610/anmd46ebbf9c8c024ef.gif">
that 's right
you really dont need a lawyer to apply for immigration to canada though its ok to hire one ... just look for people who have gone through it to guide you in filling up the forms and of course you have to do your own reading ... i found out late so better get all the info in their website : http://www.cic.gc.ca
greentea , it 's not
greentea , it 's not necessary , but some assistance of the experienced individual might be very helpful ! sometimes everything goes smooth and easy . sometimes there are hidden problems on the way . filling up the application is a very first and easiest step of the process . on the other hand , if the information provided in the application form is correct and truthful , and based on this information the person is eligible for the immigration process , it shouldnt be any issue with that . . but sometimes some unpredictable things happen . . here is the example . 5 points are given for the relatives in canada . lets say the applicant has a sister who possesses a resident status in canada . while filling in the application , the applicant adds 5 points to his score , and it helps him to get 67 points . but . . once the immigration office asks for the documents to prove the claims in the initial application . and then it turns out , that a sister doesnt live in canada at all . she lives , lets say in her home country , lebanon . and guess what , these 5 points for sister in canada are taken out of the applicant 's score . and then the applicant is left with only 62 points , which are not enough for the status of immigrant . the case is refused and closed . this is only an example . there are a lot of different things and different issues . but again , if applicant is honest , and everything is clear and not doubtful , it shouldnt be any problems . . i met one guy who wants to immigrate . . when i asked him what kind of education does he have , he said : high school . i said : there is no any chance for you . he said : oh , its not a problem . . i can get any diploma , degree , certificates you want . i said : i dont want you to get anything . i dont want you to immigrate to canada with this kind of moral norms , at the first place . <i> <b> ********************* you become responsible forever for what you have tamed . antoine de saint-exupry </b> </i> <img src="http://cdnll.img1.imagechef.com/w/080610/anmd46ebbf9c8c024ef.gif">
honesty on the application
honesty on the application is a different matter . thats down to morals and common sense . a lawyer or consultant is not all that helpful . if you have questions about the application you can usually find it on the site . if any questions arise the embassy will call you . also dont believe them when they say their clients never get interviews , these are also random and if you are on the up and up no worries . a lawyer/consultant will cost you between 2000-3000 $ . totally not worth it , just make sure you have all the required docs etc together and understand the process from the site before applying . `` diplomacy is the art of saying ` nice doggie ' until you can find a rock - will rogers ''
on my part qs
my lawyer gave me the forms to fill up then send him back the forms and the documents to go with it . later he met me again to review the filled up forms -LRB- in adobe format this time -RRB- then if entries are correct and no changes made , i signed it then send it back to him again . after a few months , he send me the file number . that 's it for 2 years i did not hear from him again . i just have to check the website for the status of my application using my file number . the next time i heard from him , he advised me to download again the same forms from the website and fill it up , sign , follow the list of exhibits to be submitted that are not yet submitted earlier then submit direct to high commission of canada within 90 days from the date the letter was issued . good thing i made a photocopy of my original documents to avoid discrepancies . so basically , in the end you still have to send updated forms direct to the high commission
tipu sultan
i am an expert in a lot of issues . . just lazy to express my knowledge , opinions and thoughts . . lol . . you have to live in canada 3 years out of 4 to be eligible to apply for the citizenship . it means if you dont leave canada for 3 years at all , then you can apply . . in case you go back and forth , you have to collect 1095 days during 4 years . you wont be able to apply for the citizenship , until you collect 1095 days during last 4 years . . <i> <b> ********************* you become responsible forever for what you have tamed . antoine de saint-exupry </b> </i> <img src="http://cdnll.img1.imagechef.com/w/080610/anmd46ebbf9c8c024ef.gif">
i agree 100 % qatarisun , the
i agree 100 % qatarisun , the forms in all are a bit complicated but i must say the lawyer does nothing . i can mail a letter for crying out loud `` diplomacy is the art of saying ` nice doggie ' until you can find a rock - will rogers ''
greentea
of course you have to send the updated forms again ! 2 years have passed !! a lot of changes in your life may occur in 2 years ! you might get married , and your educated husband will get extra points , which will make your case stronger . or other way around , you get divorced and your husband is no longer in your application . . and his points disappear along with him . . :-RRB- . . or you had a baby , and you want to include her/him into your application ... life is going on . . that 's why it 's normal to ask for the current information which is up to date . . . . but for you it 's good news . it means you are getting closer . . :-RRB- <i> <b> ********************* you become responsible forever for what you have tamed . antoine de saint-exupry </b> </i> <img src="http://cdnll.img1.imagechef.com/w/080610/anmd46ebbf9c8c024ef.gif">
dont need a lawyer
you can apply through follwing site ... http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/index.asp
yah qs
what i mean is when i filled in the forms myself i realized , why did i ever hire a lawyer ? filling up the forms and completing the exhibits is not as hard as i thought . . but then it 's done ... what to do yanni ? just wish for the best : d
thanks qatarisun/amoud . .
thanks qatarisun/amoud . . here my second question , what if someone -LRB- landed immigrant -RRB- stayed in canada for one month than came back and already has spend more than 3 years outside canada , can he/she go back or he/she has to apply again for immigration ? you would be helping a lot , thanks <p> &#160; </p> <p> onewho has n't taken risks has n't lived </p>
it depends tipu . are you
it depends tipu . are you married to a canadian citizen ? if you are married to a canadian and are accompanying them abroad you are fine . if not i would seriously check your residence status as you can not fulfil your 2 year obligation and have stayed out of the country for more than 6 months . this needs to be answered by an immigration official . `` diplomacy is the art of saying ` nice doggie ' until you can find a rock - will rogers ''
but there is no belgium
but there is no belgium embassy in qatar so where i need to try ?
immigration representatives
immigration representatives are people who offer immigration advice or assistance to visa applicants , usually for a fee . you do not need to hire an immigration representative . it is up to you . the government of canada treats everyone equally , whether they use the services of a representative or not . if you choose to hire a representative , your application will not be given special attention by the immigration officer . your representative also can not guarantee that your application will be approved . all the forms and information that you need to apply for a visa are available for free on this website . if you follow the instructions in the application guide , you can complete the application forms and submit them on your own . http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/representative/index.asp in this modern world , internet is the greate qualizer .

water and electric bills included in accomodation ?
good day ! i just want to ask if the water and electric bill is included in the accommodation since the offer was accommodation is provided ? in my offer letter they included electric allowance only specified in the job offer , so what does it mean ? do i need to pay for the electric and water bill on my own ? since the accommodation is the only they can provide ? please help me ... thank you very much ...
re : water and electric bills included in accomodation ?
yes you will have to pay your monthly utility -LRB- w/e -RRB- bills as they give you electricity allowance ... it 's in your contract . . you signed it and there 's nothing you can do about it but to abide with it ...
re : water and electric bills included in accomodation ?
as you have signed the house agreement without w/e and as your company has agreed for electricity allowance , better discuss and clear the matter with your company . that 's the only solution .
re : water and electric bills included in accomodation ?
it depends . as per your agreement you will be the one paying the utility bills as you are getting an allowance . there are many companies in qatar who are paying the utility bills but they are not giving such allowances to their employees .
re : water and electric bills included in accomodation ?
water and electric bills are provided in your accomodation . your company will be the resposible to pay it . company can not rent an accomodation if the water and electricity bill is not included in their contract with the owner of the house . if water and electric bill are not included in your accomodation , that means you are not provided with accomodation . that means you are leaving out which is the company is giving you housing allowance and it 's up to you look for an accomodation whether sharing or independent ...

i 'll be reaching doha by end
i 'll be reaching doha by end of june , hope its not before that ... last time the sandstorms were a pain ... let 's see this year ...
yes def november
info can be got from doha players - they did email me to say nov , but i ca n't find their email with dates on ! <i> this is picture is obviously not me , i do n't smoke . . <i>
ok , looks like nov
thanks , i 'll bump this post up later . i went in my first few weeks of being here in qatar . this tim ei will be better prepared and take some time off the next day so i can be around after dark =-RRB- mitch
dunestock
the last i heard it has been moved to november . i think after summer would be a little too hot . november should be cool . i hope they give enough advance notification for auditions this year . with the quad bikes issue being reduced last year -LRB- compared to 2007 -RRB- underage youth playing loud rap music and getting drunk was a rather disturbing site . too obvious to miss the fact they were not there for the music . this creates an unwanted nuisance for dune stockers with families and loyal dune stockers who have been present since it came into existance . as i musician , it put me down a bit . i missed civil defense i.e. police patrolling the area like the year before . that will automatically reduce `` underage '' activities taking place . . -LRB- or atleast in the open public -RRB- i am also aware the there has always been an issue with volunteers backing out at the end moment . i think getting a group of loyal mature musicians and music fans -LRB- period -RRB- from ql to help support dunestock would be a great idea . i think at events like these , its almost common sense that they need all the support they can get . . oh well ... just a thought ... rock n ' roll . .

district 9
any idea when district 9 movie gon na be released in qatar .
i have it , gon na start watching now
i have it in my pc , i am just about to start watching it . yes i also think it would be worth watching as imdb has given a rating of 8.9 ! -LRB- out of 10 ! -RRB- and it is currently the 78th best movie ever made ... so yea , i 'll try to post later of how it goes .

euro 2012 vs qatar 2022
if any of you have been watching the euro 2012 ... it being a small tournament compared to the world cup has soo many issues for example , croatia recently fan started throwing stuff on the pitch russians hooligans beating the hell out of the other teams fans do u think qatar can handle this ????
well ...
brute force and tyrants can stop this happenings once in a while but not always and imagine what the world will be thinking about the tyrants in qatar who go about beating and brutalizing football lovers
the dutch team will likely
the dutch team will likely find qatar to be a slight improvement , but they 're probably the only ones .
riot policemen
qatar should be prepared 10 years from now to train its riot policemen and modernize its equipment in order to handle any bloody riot incidents between fans of competing countries of world cup 2022 .
there does not seem to have
there does not seem to have been that much trouble in euro 2012 but the quality on the pitch has been good .
safety is a factor that needs
safety is a factor that needs to be maintained the russians are capable of creating another fire !!! wid all the vodka : d
i doubt that many russians
i doubt that many russians will travel to be honest . they are not known for travelling in numbers and poland is about the closet tournament they are going to get -LRB- apart from when they host the 2018 wc of course -RRB- which i think we be a complete disaster !

give us the plate number

its depends on the serial
its depends on the serial number of the car plate '' usually '' , and sometimes if it 's 4 or 3 digit , you can ask any car trader and they can give you the price , maybe you can check the special auto newspaper .

new qatar income tax law
hi friends , i am working with an international company where the new income tax law is to be implemented . could you please help me with the following ? 1 -RRB- how your companies reacted to withholding taxes thanks my blessings .
re : new qatar income tax law
dear salah , is this 5 % withholding tax can be refunded by non-resident company ? do you have idea when it comes to filing and payment ? and where to file ? thanks in advance .
re : new qatar income tax law
withholding applies only to companies that have no entity in qatar . -LRB- no commercial register -RRB- i think it 's fair as those companies do n't have expensis nor support the local economy .
re : new qatar income tax law
currently new law is put on hold ! suggest to check online at ministry of finance website for detail tax presentation and e & y or kpmg tax consultants for latest update .
re : new qatar income tax law
you can not withold paying taxes unless you are a 100 % qatari owned company .
re : new qatar income tax law
dear salah , my understanding is that withholding tax is applicable all the international transfers they do n't have a permanent establishment here . that means if we are transferring funds to head office we should have withhold . please correct me if i am wrong . thanks
re : new qatar income tax law
dear victory , i didnt know that ... ; let me check with e & y. they are also our auditors . anyway thanks a lot for the replay .
re : new qatar income tax law
victory kindly give me the link of the website.please
re : new qatar income tax law
u should understand the difference between withholding and actual taxes . as per the law which came in effect on 1/1/2010 , for those companies that are doing work in the country without being registered / do n't have cr / the owner of the contract will withhold either 5 % or 7 % -LRB- depends on the activity -RRB- of the total payment on monthly basis . this amount will be paid to the tax authority before the 15th of the following month . in my opinion , this is to encourage foreign companies to establish a base office in the country .

pls suggest me
hello i am living in india right now . i got a job offer from a public school in doha for the post of it-dept head and they want me to fly asap . offer is 4000 qr + accomodation + transport . is it good enough ? i am single and expecting a family life soon . . thanks
suggestion
offer is not bad , but the family status need atleast qar .10,000 / - pm
ask for qr10 ,000 / - package offer
dear try to convince / negotiate them for a package offer qr10 ,000 / - , then only you can apply for family visa . qr10k is salary limit for family residence visa . good luck .
i think the offer is not so
i think the offer is not so good . an it dept. head should get at least qrs - 6000 - 9000 / - and for the family status you need a minimum of 10000 / - so think & negotiate with them
dear , , this guy not
dear , , this guy not approching for the post of a principal , how can he negotiate with this , and it seems the management could be an indian .
re-think
the package is entry level only as junior executive . but if you think that your current profile is matching with these just go ahead . if you have good no : of years of it exp and good skill sets never accept this as this the most lowest salary package . regarding family status you need atleast 10,000 qr as salary and this should be shown in your monthly bank statement too . -LRB- includes/not includes hra -RRB-
hi ... which school is this
hi ... which school is this ... ... dont mind one of my friend is working with college of north atlantic and she is getting 17500qr ... ... the salary that they offered is very less ... . . dont accept less than 6000-8000 + accomdation + transport .

any qatari labour laws experts who can help please ?
under qatari labour laws , a company -LRB- especially a government organization -RRB- terminating an expatriate staff -LRB- who has worked for the company for over 5 years -RRB- is required to pay two -LRB- 2 -RRB- extra months ' salary at the end ? i got only one extra month 's salary !
re : any qatari labour laws experts who can help please ?
there is no specific provision on the labor law which states your claim unless there is an agreement between you and your company . the end of service gratuity is 3 weeks pay for every year of service . article -LRB- 54 -RRB- in addition to any sums to which the worker is entitled to upon the expiry of his service , the employer shall pay the end of service gratuity to the worker who has completed employment of one year or more . this gratuity shall be agreed upon by the two parties , provided that it is not less than a three-week wage for every year of employment . the worker shall be entitled to gratuity for the fractions of the year in proportion to the duration of employment . the worker 's service shall be considered continuous if it is terminated in cases other than those stipulated in article -LRB- 61 -RRB- of this law and is returned to service within two months of its termination . the last basic wage shall be the base for the calculation of the gratuity . the employer is entitled to deduct from the service gratuity the amount due to him by the worker .
father affair issue with other woman , please help . .

re : father affair issue with other woman , please help . .
you need to have strong evidence to support ur case ... ask your friend if he/she wants his father to be deported along with his partner . if found guilty he might have to serve a jail term before being deported ... i dont think embassy will entertain such cases . u can take help from the police .
re : father affair issue with other woman , please help . .
she should talk to his father , to clarify this issue , before anything else .

re : father affair issue with other woman , please help . .
thats quite a balancing act to be done by your friend before he needs to report to the authority . lets suppose that your friend is totally dependant on his father to support his family financially then there will be no choice to loose him out . the best option is to talk to the father to advise him what he did was morally wrong and if he has a strong religious back ground , than that would be an advantage to convince him out
re : father affair issue with other woman , please help . .
mind your own business and do n't interfere in other 's family matters .
re : father affair issue with other woman , please help . .
there 's always 3 sides to a story - his side , her side and reality . so , as the others said - better let things be sorted out privately or the repercussions could be so much greater , affecting you also . think further before you act .
re : father affair issue with other woman , please help . .
friendly speaking , it 's good for you because you care for your friend . however , you have to consider the consequences before making any action . you may worsen the situation or somewhat solve the problem . in my opinion , as a friend do n't ever interfere on a family matters . perhaps , you can advise your friend how to deal with it and solve the issue internally without involving the authorities.godbless

right , some people tell me you can get sma in megamart but it wasnt there today - things are like that here - when they are they buy lots cos it may not be there again . in carrefour they had semilac , nestle , aptamil , pediasure ensure and wyeth . on the sma website it links to wyeth - i dont know if they are made by the same company but apparently they are equivalent . if you google sma and the countries it is in it directs you to wyeth for some countries including qatar . these brands all seem to be readily available in the shops and were in a few different shops so should be easy to get hold of . if you research sma maybe it is the same as the wyeth ?? if your little one has to have sma and the link with wyeth goes nowhere then i would ship it but it 'll be fairly expensive . i guess the only alternative is to try to switch to something else thast you can get here gradually before you come so you dont have a mare when you get here ? wish you all the best with the move and the baby . my research is just testament to how bored i am as i have not yet found a job . i am also in healthcare and it seems hard for westerners to get those kind of jobs here !

relationship help
i am a christian woman living here in qatar and i fell in love with a muslim man . he says that he does not care if i convert to islam or not , but i feel that it would show that i truely care and love him if i did . what should i do ?
religion is religion
i think you should convert to muslim or he should left the muslim religion and convert to christian . its better to have the same religion with your partner in this way you will have the same faith .
i have a new software
i have a new software rligion_converter 2.012 issue 2009-2010 updated online freeware to convert from any religion to any other religon . you can find it on www.extremereligionconverter.com/marriagetomuslim yalla !
arainnaterrance
are you crazy !!
he loved you the way you
he loved you the way you are , you do n't have to change a thing about you ! however ; i recommend to read about islam to get to know it , even if you do n't convert , you 'll learn how things works for a better long-lasting relationship ! & i 'm happy for you !!! real love nowadays is kinda rare to find ! '' twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you did n't do than by the ones you did do . so throw off the bowlines . sail away from the safe harbor . catch the trade winds in your sails . explore . dream . ` discover '' mark twain
converting one 's religion is totally up to you , girl ,
converting because you 're in love with the someone is not really a valid point . it is your belief and faith that should be the major factor why you want to convert . ok , let 's say you converted to your bf 's religion : what if in the long run , you guys broke up ? you mean , you will go back to your former religion ? what is bf doing to prove his love for you ? jm28 asked you a question whether this bf has any plans of marrying you . or maybe he 's just using you . be wise ... like they say , love is blind . <a href="http://www.glitter-graphics.com"> < img src = `` http://dl4.glitter-graphics.net/pub/789/789734c9hsuc4ab6.gif '' width = 326 height = 163 border = 0 > </a> <br> < a href = `` http://www.glitter-works.org '' target = _ blank > </a> <a href="http://www.glitter-graphics.com"> < i
what is the aim of love
if he loves you to be his wife that is alright religion does n't matter but before going in process of marriage u both have to understand each others cultural respects and make predecision of where u both have to live .

religion is not the big
religion is not the big problem as long you love each other and both of you can understand the situation.respect both openion and belief thats it .
pray to god for guidance and
pray to god for guidance and trust your heart . reflect on what marriage means and give a thought to your future if you do not convert and have children . this seems to be the biggest problem in these relationships . you may both be secure in your individual faiths , but your children may suffer . sorry to bring in a down point , just want to be a sincere advisor to you .
live and love your life ... .
does religion really matters to you then why at the first place enter into a relationship ! it is your personal call ... mutually agree or compromise decide before marriage .
convert if you believe in
convert if you believe in islam otherwise plenty of ways to show that you care .
he knows i care . and hes
he knows i care . and hes open to christianity . i dont really care about the religion aspect in relationships . . its not quite my forte
just go
get him . marry him . you convert or you dont convert thats upto you . <img src="http://www.qatarliving.com/files/images/da.gif">
do not convert to please
do not convert to please people . religion is not about pleasing people . its about pleasing god !
i dont care about pleasing
i dont care about pleasing people . i know i have the ability to please everybody , it 's just if their worthy of being pleased or not is the question .
because you dont deserve to
because you dont deserve to be pleased by me .
no need for you to convert
he has the right to ask you to convert and you have the right to accept or no . if a christian woman fall in love with a muslim man then they can marry and the muslim man should not force her . but really if you love him you should tell him that you are willing to know about islam , then you can marry him and who knows maybe you will convert . you can marry him and he should not force you at all .
will you can convert secretly
if you convert you will please yourself first and you may marry this man .
anyways , in true love ,
anyways , in true love , religion should never be an issue ... boston is correct , just show him that you really love and care . <a href="http://photobucket.com/images/dragon%20gif" target="_blank"> <img src="http://i145.photobucket.com/albums/r202/mooncapsule/caro%20perso/dragon-ball-z2049.gif" border="0" alt="dragon-ball-z%20(49).gif pictures, images and photos"/> </a>
wait ...
before you think of converting , ask him first if he plans to marry you and ask him to let you meet his parents ... from that point you can think of converting or not <a href="http://www.qatarliving.com/user/greentea"> <img src="http://lc.fdots.com/cc/lc/78/780fbc341ac46d9fc618695ae3c23eaf.jpg" border="0" alt="myhotcomments.com"> </a> <br> < a href =
even if he plans to marry
even if he plans to marry does n't mean that he is going to marry you !
especially not , when he is
especially not , when he is an egyptian !
please do not revert for
please do not revert for love , marriage or friendship . if you want to convert into any religion , take your time , study about that religion , once you satisfied yourself , then you can proceed for reverting to islam . otherwise dont do it ... as your thread it is very well known that , you are in deep love with him ... in my opinion religion doesnt matter at all ... wishing you a successfull marriage life ...

who said anything about being egyptian boston ? what would happen when a red quark and a green quark love eachother though ?

hello smoke , firmware 05.14.02 , can not be unlocked for other carrier , once phone upgraded to os4 .1 its firmware automatically changed to 05.14.02 . there is no way you can down grade to previous firmware . phone with os4 .1 can be jailbroken with limera1n , carriee unlock is not possible as of now . dev team is working on it but no solution as yet .

deportation
if arrested while on a visiting visa , are you definitly going to get deported ?

let 's put it this way , why
let 's put it this way , why would qatar want to retain a visitor who not only fights in bars but raises enough ruckus to get arrested fighting in bars ? i think they do n't want his kind here . mandi
depending on how you were arrested ,
if you are on visit visa status and have been over staying in qatar problems are your passport might have been given to the cid by your agency ex . fahad , cleopatra and evryday of lapse visa will be equivalent to a certain fine . they will ask you to pay a certain amount to get your passport so you can get back to your home country . if your question is arresting you in some criminal offense like carrying dangerous alcohol , drugs etc. then yes you might be deported.in some cases your relatives or friends in doha will not even know you have been deported .
arrested for fighting in bars

maybe caught doing illegal

labour law vs contract
fellas , been in doha for a bit and might have an oportunity to relocate somewhere else for work reasons . my contract is for 1 year and states 3 months notice period . looking into the labour law act it states that if i have worked for less than a year in the companbject to 1 week notice ... would the labour law prevail over the contract or i will have to stick to the contract ? any help would be highly appreciated . best , muthoid
my opinion
you have to follow the employment contract . the law will be followed if there is no provision for this subject . and also as long as the provision in the employment contract is not axactly unconscionably against the law , then the employment contract should prevail .
`` the law will be followed if there is no provision for this ''
thanks amici for your reply ... but the point is that the law seem to say that less than 1 year = 1 week !?!? - you should never underestimate the predictability of stupidity -
i agree with amici ... as u

do you believe in ghosts ?
so i was chatting to my friend on the phone last night , she beleives her school is haunted by an old tribe spirits . however , according to a recent study , the haunting feelings exist but the ghosts do not - do you agree ? have you ever had any unusual , inexplicable experiences ? do you believe in ghosts ?
nope
i do n't believe in spirits of dead coming back to haunt us , but i do believe in demons !

a professor at the university
a professor at the university of tottenham was giving a lecture on paranormal studies . . to get a feel for his audience , he asks : `` how many people here believe in ghosts ? '' about 90 students raise their hands . `` well , thats a good start . out of those who believe in ghosts , do any of you think you have seen a ghost ? '' about 40 students raise their hands . . `` thats really good . i 'm really glad you take this seriously . has anyone here ever talked to a ghost ? '' about 15 students raise their hands . . `` has anyone here ever touched a ghost ? '' 3 students raise their hands ... `` thats fantastic . now let me ask you one question further ... have any of you ever made love to a ghost ? '' way in the back , marconandoz-01 raises his hand . the professor takes off his glasses and says : `` son all the years i 've beee giving this lecture , no one has ever claimed to have made love to a ghost . you 've got to come up here and tell us about your experience . '' middle eastern marconandoz-01 replied with a nod and a grin , and began to make his way up to the podium . when he reached the front of the room , the professor asks : `` so marconandoz-01 , tell us what its like to have sex with a ghost ? '' marconandoz-01 replied : `` oh shyte , from way back there , i thought you said goats ''

well , strange spirits have
well , strange spirits have been apart of out family for some time . they are very helpful to us . lol i have never experienced these spirits myself but specific family members have repeatedly spoken about their encounters . 1 . grandmother was about to be hit by a bus . and ` somebody ' picked her up and moved her out of the way . turned around to say thanks but mysteriously no one was there . 2 . grandmother again when she was a child was in her room when a fire started . freaked out as she was a strange spirit -LRB- what she thought was an angel -RRB- came down and told her ' `` do n't be afraid . '' and she calmed down and she sat down not being afraid . until her father came breaking down the door screaming like `` what the hell is the matter with you !!! '' but she just said , `` i am not afraid . '' :d 3 . great grandmother was about to touch a high voltage wire until she sees this ` angel ' spirit sitting right in front of it ! 4 . my aunt is a little different hers are more like freaky strange spirits not as helpful as the others . :d her 's are more disturbing the peace by shutting and slamming doors randomly around the house . and many more of other stories of such experiences . some are indeed friendly ghosts though ! : d

my tips
having been to paris twice now . 1 . buy a guide book -- they have several at jarir or virgin . 2 . agree with above poster : a. sacre coeur better than notre dame . i also like saint chapelle better , which is only about a block from notre dame . b. metro is fabulous c. lourve is huge , just run to your favorites and skip the rest . d. i enjoyed versailles , especially the grounds . e. eiffel tower lines can be long or short depending on day and time . if super long , then leave and come back later . f. walk around in the jardin des tuileries .

you should plan it very well so that you do n't waste any of your time there . search in the internet what places in paris would be very interesting for you . i suggest , t he best place to view eiffel tower is in tocadero . try to find , a map that will guide you on how to use the metro system in france . if you have plan of going to disneyland , one day is n't enough if you have kids . i hope this is useful enough and enjoy !

make sure you visit the
make sure you visit the catacombs , which are underground tunnels stuffed with human bombs . creepy , but very interesting . notre dame is interesting , but sacre couer is my favorite by far . if you 're not really into art then the lourve can prove to be an expensive waste of time . it 's huge , and it can take you hours to find the stuff you really want to see . the musee d'orsay is a much smaller gallery with a much more focussed collection of impressionist masterpieces . get to know the metro system , it is an amazing way to get around . the palais garnier is an underrated attraction . hopefully you can visit on a day that is operating tours . i really enjoy the restaurants in the marais area , if you 're looking for some place to eat .
imtinan . . safe trip to paris
few more tips , if you still have n't traveled yet . for music visit : palais garnier . for shopping and reasonably priced souvenirs visit : lafayette and rue de la huchette -LRB- this oldest street has lots of yummy shawerma -RRB- curiousbutdetermined on the louvre : `` see what napoleon has stolen from egypt '' , the same applies to the british museum , it contains the largest egyptian antiquities collection , confiscated by the british army back in the days . novi : remember this ? you had us fooled for a while . . lol http://www.qatarliving.com/node/92952 salam

paris favorites : eating ,
paris favorites : eating , drinking and shoopping.no , sure not that all limited when the place is paris.do not by pass visiting muse de la mode -LRB- 10 , avenue pierre ier de serbie -RRB- the museum is a treasure trove of fashions from the 18th - 20th centuries , it would be a great off the beaten path stop for a trip to paris and some other tips for you ; tip # 1 for paris - if you are in paris driving a car , be aware that people in paris drive however they want to . tip # 2 - if you have a car , get a good tourist book which will tell you where and where not to park . tip # 3 - learn a bit of french . a great book which has a lot of basic phrases and fun things to try is rick steves ' handy pocketbook guide to basic french -LRB- find book -RRB- tip # 4 - use the metro -LRB- the subway -RRB- . there is simply no better way to get around paris . but make sure you 've brushed up on your french . it will help with buying tickets and understanding the maps in the subways . tip # 5 - the lines and crowds at the eiffel tower can get very long . if you must see the lights of paris at night -LRB- and you should -RRB- go on a week night -LRB- not friday -RRB- , or make reservations . tip # 6 - the louvre . from what i understand , if you are an art lover and really appreciate art museums , you could spend weeks there , but for most people , half a day is enough time . you see the famous pictures -LRB- mona lisa -RRB- , and spend some time looking at the amazing art . if you go on sunday morning and get there as they 're opening , it 's free admission . tip # 7 - if there is one place that is absolutely crazy to drive in paris , it 's in the roundabout that goes around the arc d'triomphe . if you rent a car and drive here , just go travelling around in your car like you would if there were no rules . tip # 8 - there are lots of wonderful museums in france ! one of them is the pantheon , which was originally a church , and originally planned to be something other than that . victor hugo and some other famous french people are buried there . make sure you set aside some time and some money to visit the museums if that 's something you want to do . tip # 9 - have some small change -LRB- or large change if you can afford it -RRB- on hand for the street performers . they 're pretty good ! tip # 10 - if you like looking at the inside of churches , take some time for notre ' dame , and if you have a problem with crowds , do n't go on the weekend . people were pretty respectful inside the cathedral on the weekdays , but there are a lot of people there on the weekends , so you end up waiting in line , and it gets more noisy inside . tip # 11 - if you want to see the eiffel tower light up and sparkle at night , get there right before the hour . tip # 12 - if you see a person on the street who is selling something and wants to sketch you or give you something for free , do n't be fooled by talk which says they 'll so something for free . it is n't free ! __________________________________________ <b> attitudes are more important than facts ... </b>

buying a personal car
i am planning to purchase my own car and will buy a second hand unit on cash basis . being an expat how should i go with the process . do i still need to get a letter from my employer allowing me to purchase my personal car . appreciate much to anyone that could give me some ideas and feedback . thank you
re : buying a personal car
if you have driving liciense , you can purchase cars without any letter from your sponsor.to get the liciense you already have got the letter to submit in the driving school , now u r entitled to own a car , go ahead , wish you all the best .
re : buying a personal car
u need an noc from ur sponsor , even if u have a driving licence .
re : buying a personal car
1 . select a car of ur choice . 2 . take it to computer checking . 3 . once u r satisfied with the test , negotiate the price . 4 . go to muroor with the letter from ur sponsor , id card , qr250 and the owner of the car , to transfer it to ur name . take an atm or credit card as they do n't accept cash . muroor has typing centre , where u will type the form in arabic , with ur details and cars .
re : buying a personal car
we too have a secondhand car . . first thing we did was , request an noc from our sponsor since this was needed when we had the process of car transfer , photocopies of id 's ... just make sure the car you are buying is in very good condition and the insurance or istimara are valid for another -LRB- 3-6 mos -RRB- , 1 year is better . that way you have ample time to have it check or no more cash are going out of your pocket for repair . one more thing . . check if the car has any traffic violation before the transfer that way the first owner will pay it . . on our case we just found out day after that the car has violation on the same day we got the car ... too bad for us -LRB- we tried to request for photo -RRB- to check if it 's really our car but the police ca n't present any proof cause it 's a parking violation and it 's the mobile police who noted it . we paid it & we do n't want to argue anymore . . just had it on the wrong time ; the violation was made in a place we never visited and the owner of the car already left the country . anyway goodluck on your new car .

i was been cancelled before then recently came back to doha . after i inquired with my previous bank , they gave me the same bank account as my previous one . same thing with q-tel , i applied for new connection and still they asked me to pay my outstanding bill which is under my id number -LRB- i did not pay before my arrears since it is just less than 300 qr -RRB- . therefore , they will not cancel your account even if your work visa is cancelled .
re : bank account status after leaving doha ??
they do n't have time to update / cancel the a/c 's of left peoples coz . . they are running with short of time to give proper in time service to the existing costomers .
re : bank account status after leaving doha ??
i agree with yoiu that they dont update the data . but dont force me to beleive they give excellent service to exsitng customers . . it is a matter of technology how to be used . if yoiu go out of your country after visa cancellation without repaying the loan , how they catch you at airport ? ... so if they want to update data , they do it ,

job resignation within contract
is it possible to resign from the job within the contract period ? is it necessary to pay the company expense for accepting my resignation ?
i know that : if ur company
i know that : if ur company accepts and not ask u for money , u dont have to pay , but if they told u they will not accept to end ur work with them they will ask u and u should give them money , but here in qatar i think that u dont have to pay them if they still want u to work with them and they wil ask u for money thats if u came in ur hasbund visa
it 's possible to resign from
it 's possible to resign from the job within contract period . well , this depends upon what your contract says . if your contract specifies that `` if you resign before agreed period then the expenses occured -LRB- for your training , visa , ticket etc. -RRB- would be born by you '' . then yes , you have to pay the company expenses .
resingation
i have received the appointement letter but not contract . and it is not signed by the ministry . so the contract is valid or not ?

used car loan
does anybody know processes of used car loan?banks are paying directly to dealer?if yes , where is the guarantee for seller?is dealer paying to seller after transfering the registeration of car to buyer?i am planing to sell my car but confused about the process
re : used car loan
if its a 2nd hand car your talking about , then do not go to the banks . go to financing company , like jazeera finance or first finance . they have much better rates & the model of the car does n't matter .
re : used car loan
thanks for info i am the seller and i just want to know when i will get my payment , what is payment process ?
re : used car loan
your car is thru car loan and you want to sell it ? the buyer must pay first , then you go to the bank to pay the car loan amount -LRB- full -RRB- , ask for the clearance from the bank for the full payment of the car loan . -LRB- 2days -RRB- once you have the clearance , you can proceed to traffic dept. for the transfer of ownership -LRB- seller and buyer -RRB- .
re : used car loan
if you have a buyer already and he/she wants to pay your car from a bank loan ? he should first go to a car dealer , he will get a quotation from them -LRB- qr1000 fee -RRB- , take it to the bank . bank will give him the money , he then pay you . after receiving the payment you can give him you car.of course he will do all the transfer of ownership procedure .
re : used car loan
thanks for useful info , the buyer wants to buy my car via car loan -LRB- commercial bank -RRB- , and the bank asked from buyer to bring the quotation from dealer which we provided already now , that is ok but bank is telling that they will make the payment to dealer directly and than i will get my money from dealer , is it correct?i dont understand this part in case dealer does not want to pay it to me , where is my guarantee ?
can i sell my car still under car loan from the bank
i took car loan from the bank for 4 years . 3 years are already completed . can i sell this car without informing the bank , because i am paying with check book every month they are taking my money from my bank . how about the change over process ? thanks for sharing
re : can i sell my car still under car loan from the bank
yes , you can sell your car . you have to take the buyer of your car to the bank and settle all your remaining amount in the bank plus pay you if the total price of the car beyond or higher than the remaining amount in the bank . after that process done , the bank will give out noc to you for you to hand over the noc to the new buyer for him to process with the traffic police department to change the ownership . you have to go along with the new buyer to the insurance company to change the ownership before proceed to the traffic police department for changing the ownership and renewal of the registration card . cheers . .
re : can i sell my car still under car loan from the bank
dann is correct . you can either go to the registration dept first if the buyer feel un-secure and then go to the insurance company second . but first you must go to the bank along with you buyer to clear the outstanding amount before proceeding . if buyer has an account in the same bank , then bullseye ! your task is much easier .
re : can i sell my car still under car loan from the bank
if you look at the reverse -LRB- back -RRB- of your car registration card , at the right hand bottom you will see a column ` type of ownership ' in arabic nough almukia . if you have your banks name written there , you can not sale this car without a no objection letter from the bank .

can i exit with the rp on the old passport ?
dear all , i have just renewed my passport . however , due to the work i was not able to transfer the resident permit on the old passport to the new passport . will it be a issue if i want to get the exit permit for a short business trip then come back to qatar to work ? how long it gon na take if i wan na transfer my resident permit to the new passport ? thank you regards , lim
your old passport must have
your old passport must have been cancelled when you renew it . nobody is allowed to travel with cancelled or expired passport . you can give an allowance of at least one hour to transfer your rp to your new passport . the payment of that transaction is qatari riyals 110 .
you can travel with both
you can travel with both passports , just because your old passport is cancelled doe n't make your rp cancelled . i had the same issue last year and just showed my rp in my old passport to immigration , this was n't a problem ... but arrange to have it transferred as soon as you can
you have transfer to the new
you have transfer to the new passport , which will not take much time .
i agree with raven1968 , take
i agree with raven1968 , take both when you travel , you will be fine in the way back .
habibmdh you dont have to ,
habibmdh you dont have to , its advisable you do ... i was travelling with my rp in my old passport for 4 months before my rp was renewed in my new passport , never once had a problem at immigration
weng
raven is correct - i have traveled with both passports ... as the rp had n't expired
working visa requires an exit
working visa requires an exit permit to travel outside the country whereas family visa does not require any exit permit . to apply for an exit permit , a person needs a valid passport , not passports . i supposed raven and oryx are holding family visas .

dear ql 's ... i have aoa 150 netbook with windows xp installed when i bought it , i like to try windows 7 , i want to know if in case i dont like window 7 can i install window xp back , the original one which i 'm supposed to replace ? or i can have them both install in my netbook without any problems?help plsss , , , thanks in advance .
re : somebody enlighten me pls . .
since windows 7 is just being released i would say `` do not install it yet '' and wait some time until you can get some feedback from those already using it . i know there is a way to have more than one os in the hd and to have the pc/laptop ask you with which os you want to start , but in this case someone with more knowledge should give you a hand on that . i guess it is related to partition the hd and install each os in each partition available ; thus it has to be a high capacity hd . regards !!
re : somebody enlighten me pls . .
well normally you get a back up disk which you can use to reinstall your original windows that came with your netbook , but sometimes its kept in a un accessable location on say your second partition . so first confirm that . to answer your questions yes you can install windows 7 and have xp if you install them on two separate partitions . you dont want dual operating systems on your netbook then go ahead and just install win7 you can always downgrade later without any problems , provided you have your xp cd : -RRB-
re : somebody enlighten me pls . .
appreciate that , , , thanks .
re : somebody enlighten me pls . .
guys i only have this mini netbook , it does n't come with cd , so how can i install it back ? and how to do the partition you were saying ? sorry , dnt know much about lap . . thanks again .
re : somebody enlighten me pls . .
thanks smoke , , , i appreciate that .
re : somebody enlighten me pls . .
better if you just stick with xp as minipc were designed for if you like to try window 7 then upgrade your pc to higher one sell it and buy new . c , -RRB- cheersss !!!

hi
hi sameer how are you ? well sharing my experience , i would say 10k is less , try to locate the major expenditures , like doctor , schooling , or even include atleast once in a week dinner at some good place , buying a car and then its maintenance , if you ask me i would recommend you to negotiate with them for atleast 15k with house allowances , or ask them to provide company maintain car and family medicle , i am sure you must have good credentials ?

labour law of 6 days of leave for 1 day leave
i am working in a private company running many institutions.i would like to know if there is rule in qatar labour law which states that if i take leave for 1 day due to personal reason on sunday i can join only on saturday loosing 6 days of salary for 1 day leave , they also reduce house allowance of six days since i am on leave for six days . please any one can guide me about which law the management is following . with regards dream team

from thur or sunday depends
from thur or sunday depends
depends on the management ,
depends on the management , generally and as per labour law it is three working days starting from the first day of eid , management of each company can extend it as per their policies
according to my secret agent
according to my secret agent it 's friday , saturday , and sunday . make sure your company gives you sunday off !
our private company is giving us eid holidays on oct 28 , 29 & 30
plus the 26th and 27th - so it 's 5days holidays !
as per labour law it is 3
as per labour law it is 3 working days and if you are not working normally on saturdays then it will be possibly from friday to tuesday . if you are normally working on saturdays it will be from friday to monday . some companies follow the labour law but there are a lot of private companies giving only one or two days .
`` as per labour law it is 3
`` as per labour law it is 3 working days . '' is that the law ? then i will insist on sunday . monday , and tuesday off , and i will take wednesday and thursday , too , because it makes no sense to come in for two days . thanks , cherukkan .
toyota prado car servicing
can anyone recommend a good car service place for my prado using toyota spare parts ? i have just imported my 1 year old prado from dubai and local toyota garage want qar 5000 just to register it on their system - robbery with the lights on i say !!! any suggestions gratefully received . regards tony
re : toyota prado car servicing
all the major car companies chrage the same here unless you have gcc coverage
re : toyota prado car servicing
i imported prado from dubai an year ago and toyota dealer asked the same . i am taking the vehicle to tayseer service station and they are excellent . you can actually monitor what technician is doing . make sure that he follows the maintenance schedule . even if you flush the engine , change japan make oil filter and use mobile 10,000 km oil it will not cost more than 300 qr where as in toyota , the same with 5000 km oil will cost around qr 800 1000 . go to salwa road tayseer and get the vehicle serviced in less than 2 hrs . in toyota dealer it will take not less than one entire day .
re : toyota prado car servicing
just noticed you said your car is one year old . for sure it is under warranty so check with toyota dubai to see if your warranty is valid at any toyota dealer which it should be . it is possible that the story i relayed to you was in fact i believe either toyota or bmw . if your warranty is valid i would definitely go to the proper authorities at the ministry of economy and commerce and report the toyota dealer . make them service your vehicle under the conditions of the warranty you agreed to . believe me they know what they are doing and they know it is wrong but yet they still try to bend the conditions to their liking . make them honor the rules they have the responsibility to uphold . i am sure for every car they have to service from outside qatar there is one that leaves they dont have to .
re : toyota prado car servicing
in addition to complaining to the ministry , send a complaint to toyota-japan ; i 'm sure they do n't accept such crooked practices ; and if they do , never buy a toyota again .
re : toyota prado car servicing
other than american cars none of the other cars are provided ggc-wide warranty . check your documents . if you dont have gcc wide warranty then there is nothing much even the ministry can do and neither will toyota hq do anything about it .
re : toyota prado car servicing
teyseer may be ok for routine oil change , filter etc - but in know toyota has a service checklist for a certain odometer reading . are there garages in qatar that can do this type of service . mine is a fortuner imported from bahrain . i am nearing 40k on the odo . i would like to take it to a garage that does the proper job - if any one knowss such a place . rgs

re : passport for my kid
check with your embassy for details on this `` application '' regards !!
re : passport for my kid
if you son is in india -LRB- chennai -RRB- you should apply there for his passport . you can not apply for a passport for anyone who is not residing in qatar . you should get a sworn affidavit attested by the indian emabssy even for applying the passport for your son in india .

can i get the sworn affidavit here in indian embassy .
re : passport for my kid
yes ... you can get the sworn affidavit here . child birth certificate & your marriage certificate copies to be provided along application apart from your passport copy .
re : passport for my kid
sorry , i forgot to mention attaching the copy of the birth certificate with form c1 . marriage certificate is not necessary . passport copies of both mother and father are to be attached if both of them are here .

vacuum cleaner for pet hair
friends , i need to buy vacuum cleaner which can use for normal cleaning as well as which can remove cat hairs from velvet sofas . any suggestion ? and estimated cost of it ?
re : vacuum cleaner for pet hair
i suggest you brush your pets more often . wet the brush first then the hairs will stick to the brush .
re : vacuum cleaner for pet hair
there are really not special vacuum cleaner available in the market . it is really not advisable to vacuum clean your cat . you have to be very cautious while doing so as you may scare the cat by the noise and sometime by the accidently stuck your cleaner to the cat skin -LRB- it really scary for the pet -RRB- . instead you brush you pet everyday this will help to clean as well as massage the skin by increasing the circulation of blood . brush also help to find out the skin affection if any still you want one -- buy any small low power/speed hand held portable vacuum cleaner . look for the smallest portable one . hope this will help

beetle 2000
<p> your beetle is same as mine in term of model . </p> <p> i have a diagnostic system for vw seat and audi which will tells what </p> <p> is wrong in the ecu , or any control module.reset airbag light , reset engine light </p> <p> and pull the fault code stored in the ecu , so that repair can be pin pointed directly to the real problem , eliminate of waste repair which does not need . </p> <p> vw cars are sometime very sensitive , after remove battery sometime engine wont run correctly , ended up with the need to reset the throttle body alignment , which only can be done by diagnostic tool . </p> <p> </p> <p> i did all above things myself with my vag-com device , i am not a mechanic , thus when i need to repair my car i will still have to call a mechanic . </p> <p> but he will do according to the finding of the diagnostic \ </p> <p> back to your car ... what is the symtomps you experience ? </p> <p> </p>

steps for hiring a maid

i think you have to apply for
i think you have to apply for a visa for this maid .
as far as i know , you need to
as far as i know , you need to get a noc letter from your employer , which should state that they have no object to you applying for a maid and also stating your salary , and the nationality of the maid you want to get . take this to the labour department on c-ring road -LRB- i guess -RRB- , there is an application form that you need to get filled in and submit with the noc . will take atleast a week for the approval to come . once you get the approval , give this to any manpower agency that brings in maids , and they will handle the rest in terms of getting the visa , flights , etc. .

dog grooming
we are looking at moving to qatar , we have a cockapoo who needs regular clipping , is it easy to find dog groomers . are dogs allowed on the beaches and are there many places to walk dogs in doha ? thanks anxious dog owner
yes there are dog groomers
there are 2 vets that offer the service . doha vets and qatar vet centre dog walking places are minimil . if you are going to be staying in a compound , you would be able to walk around there . cornish is another option , but you get hassled by locals who will tell you that its not allowed , but there are no signs , so i generally ignore them and tell them that my dogs are not bothering them , and until there are signs i will keep walking my dogs there . the best place is from the emiri diwan side towards the new islamic museum . never in the direction of sheraton , as there are many more people . there are a few beaches , but on weekends too many crowds . walking through the streets you will be hassled by people driving by , barking at you , or asking how much you will sell your dog for , or generally just harrassing if you are a woman . hope this helps . <p> `` if you do n't like the heat ... get out of the kitchen ... but stop trying to fan the flames before you leave ... it will burn you on the a ** as you go through the doorway ...

alienware in qatar ??
hello everybody , i was just wondering if there are any alienware resellers here in qatar as i plan on purchasing a new laptop , and so far i ca n't seem to find any . any help would be very appreciated , thanks in advance !
my suggestion
get your own customized from alienware :-RRB- its worth the wait !
virgin - landmark
i saw a beautiful alienware laptop in the virgin store at landmark last saturday - i have no idea of the price , i just know i ca n't afford it !
you mean vilagio 's virgin
do you know which alienware it was ? 11 , 15 or 17 inches ?
get urs from usa
get it custom made and at half the price ! go for it !
wish i could !
well i really wan na go for it , but -LRB- you might not be aware of this -RRB- since late january intel has recalled all its new sandy bridge chipsets which the new alienware m17x-r3 is equiped with , so production of this model has been stopped ever since , and it 's due to be resumed early march hopefully , so until then my hands are tied !
alienware
you will find it in virgin megastore there lot alienware models there . prices are i guess 13000,26000,6000 +
do n't buy it locally , either
do n't buy it locally , either go to dubai and get one there or buy it online and ship it through aramex . all the alienwares you 'll find here will be outdated or super expensive . but even if you buy it online , for good specs you 're looking at 2000 - $ 2500 excluding aramex fees . buy an msi instead , they 're fairly cheap and look cool . or if you 're willing to buy online check sager . i bought one recently and it 's been working like a charm .
i saw one alienware laptop at
i saw one alienware laptop at virgin megastore in villagio . you may look for some dell resellers .
very rarely seen in qatar .

qatar doesnt have any specific store
suggest you build your own specs and order directly from the us . even if you find any alienware in qatar the specs would be limited . i have some friends who directly ordered from the us as they did not like the specs available here . it was mere basic and super expensive as always . best of luck .
actually that 's what i had in
actually that 's what i had in mind , but my concern was does dell ship to qatar ? how exactly did your friends receive their laptops ?
i have been looking for an hp
i have been looking for an hp i7 , dv6 3175 past two months , this great country doesnt have them . you get it in any kiosk in dubai . gr8 qatar
let 's say my customization
let 's say my customization adds up to 3000 $ , if customs are at 5 % then that would make 150 $ , so why 700 $ ? and ca n't i order directly from dell ?
pro gamer
i think you are confused , any items imported to qatar more than 700 usd has around 5 % tax . but obviously before shipping you better call aramex or dhl and confirm them the actual invoice amount so they can confirm to you . regarding dell , i am not sure but on amazon and bestbuy you have tons of alien ware on sale .
oh ok got it , i mis
oh ok got it , i misunderstood you the first time , i thought that i have to pay 700 $ of taxes . thank you very much for your help i really appreciate it . one last question , do you have any idea how much to expect for the shipping ?
i know . .
i know someone selling his alienware comp with full accessories ...
i have one ... different specs
i have one ... different specs from the one in virgin villagio ...
do you have details of the
do you have details of the full specs and what condition it 's in ?

thanks a lot for the
thanks a lot for the post ! only problem is there is no contact number , and i ca n't pm since i only just created an account on that website , so all i did was reply to his post , hope it 's still available and at a good price

maternity clothes
any advice on where to buy maternity clothes ? so far , the few malls i 've looked has either a terrible selection -LRB- i.e. a selection of 3 different items -RRB- or the prices are out of control . i 'm to the point of buying online and paying to ship . any ideas ? -LRB- please , serious comments only , i 'm in no mood for sarcastic , silly , male humor this morning ... -RRB-
i guess then you must have
i guess then you must have already tried mamas & papas -LRB- villagio -RRB- mothercare -LRB- cc -RRB- and m & s -LRB- villagio -RRB-
hi minoush , i think you
hi minoush , i think you probably tried these shops already , ie , mothercare , marks and spencer , bhs , next . yup selection is awful , and prices are ouch . have you tried h & m ? they did have many trousers , price range was 160-250qar . the other thing to do would be to invest in good pair of basic colour trousers and get your tops stitched .
have n't tried mothercare at
have n't tried mothercare at cc . i hate going there but i may have to ... m & s does not have a maternity section . i do n't get this ... every local has at least 5 kids , plus every expat seems to be pregnant . where do they all shop for clothes ?
mothercare is likely to have
mothercare is likely to have but again prices are just too much . i think it would just be better of you have them shipped in . have you also tried babyhope ? i think they have a maternity section too ... h & m is also a good try .
i tried h & m and their
i tried h & m and their selection was ok . the only problem were the pants had this new fangled design where the waist is supposed to sit below your waist and it felt like my pants were about to fall down . just too hip and cool for me . i 'm old and i need mom jeans ! :--RRB- i will try bhs . i 'm used to target and discount stores . the idea of paying $ 80 - $ 100 for a pair of pants that i will wear for 6 months is impossible . checked online , shipping from motherhood maternity from the states is $ 70 for a ton of clothes . i think i will just do that ... thanks ladies ! -LRB- and thank you men for holding in your impossibly crude comments that you all love to make on every thread ! -RRB-
babyshop and max
try babyshop and max in city center . thay have good collection
hi minoush , you will have to
hi minoush , you will have to go to mothercare at cc , because apparently all maternity wear from other mc shops are to shift to mc of cc , if not already there . you need to visit the mc inside debenhams . the locals wear the abbaya , so a loose gown inside -LRB- the jalabiyas , more like the house maxis -RRB- is not visible to anybody . among asian clothes there are many loose tops in style right now , with lycra tights , so again no problems there . getting t 's is not an issue , as long as you are okay with it hugging you tight all day . the trouser style , is the low bump style right now , and it doesnt really fall off.h & m had the high waist trousers . not sure about baby shop for maternity clothes , else you may have to try the large clothes section , like evans , if you are looking for comfy tops . check giordano as well , they dont have maternity , but they usually have these loose comfy linen trousers that you can tie under the bump .
lol han - you have really
lol han - you have really been shopping ! ... :d minoush - han has given you a very deatiled reply . now get ready to get yourself to cc ... :-RRB- and congrats : -RRB-

my advice , try to shop all u can now , bfore the back pain starts , im 9 months pregnant now and waited to long to shop and has being painfull since here u have to walk so so much to find anything , the shop list is fine , there is nursing bras only in mark and spencer in villagio and in max in cc , the prices are much better in max so its up to u , i personally think that the sell everything to expensive for some cloth u will b using for so little time , wish u good luck with ur shopping and congratz ! : -RRB-
i share the same sentiments
i share the same sentiments with you with my 2 consecutive pregnancies . on my 1st child , i got most of my maternity clothes from my country . i got good pairs of jeans in mothercare in debenhams in cc and tops in h & m. on my 2nd , i got everything -LRB- from short/long dress , tops and bottoms -RRB- online and have it shipped thru shop and ship via aramex .

its near grand hamad street , they sell affordable maternity clothes ... also try ansar gallery , 4th floor city centre ,

i have failed my driving 4 times from karwa driving school . i have taken 1 month course . can i apply for driving test again ? what is the procedure ?
re : i have faild 4 times my driving test from karwa . can ...
my dear , i suggest you not to worry . i also took full driving course from karwa driving school . while taking the course instructor told me that i may pass in my first attempt . but unfortunately i failed 3 times . i passed only on my 4th attempt . i accept that karwa driving school is good for learning driving but during test because of several people there will be little bit tension . regarding your question , again you have to join either 7day -LRB- 1 chance will be given for test -RRB- or 15day -LRB- 2 to 3 chances will be given for test -RRB- course to reapper the test . dont worry you will pass when your time comes . before , i also more worried about driving license . finally i am driving on roads very safely . best of luck , rama

re : i have faild 4 times my driving test from karwa . can ...
first of all dont worry . i am taking driving classes in al rayah . i passed l and parking but failed in road due to my silly mistake . and during the test i met people who are attending test 6th time and unfortunately they failed . but some attending test 3rd time have passed . may be god wants u to be perfect.so dont lose heart . be patient ... i guess u need to pay again and attend another course . its damn tiring and hectic but we need license right . and my next road test is tomorrow ... i have submitted everything to god ... may i pass ...
re : i have faild 4 times my driving test from karwa . can ...

having known women involved in polygyny i found it really sad to see the toll it took on their self-esteem and the way their husbands played one off against the other to gain `` top spot '' . i realize that not all polygynous marriages are like that , but all i have known are . also , outside of religion i have to agree with gypsy . if it is supposed to be so easy for a woman to accept her mate sleeping with someone else , then men should be able to handle it too . the fact that you know you can not , shows you know it also presents a serious hardship on women -- even if it is `` allowable '' according to religion or law . <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> <strong> i refuse to drink the kool-aid ! </strong> -- <em> pm </em> </p>
that 's not true keiko
before you post about something being allowable in islam you should really do your research carefully , rather than just take one person 's word for it . the only firm requirement is that the man be fair among his wives with regards to time and money spent . and one can not exceed having 4 wives at a time . <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> <strong> i refuse to drink the kool-aid ! </strong> -- <em> pm </em> </p>

more thoughts on polygamy : ... ... koran or quran noble verse : sura 4:3 http://www.submission.org/suras/sura4.htm ... ... . http://www.answering-christianity.com/polygamy.htm
keiko , i am sure all of us muslims know this surah
and what we know is that based on the quran and hadith a muslim man is allowed to have up to 4 wives providing he can support them equally and divides his time equally . a muslim woman has the right to choose not to be in a polygynous marriage and she can divorce a husband who chooses this against her wishes . muslims feel that polygyny is a right granted by allah and although it may not be advisable to exercise every right , a man who is hell-bent on having more than one wife will do so , using his religious right to do so . i 'm not really sure what you are trying to add here or getting at with these links but believe me , this has been discussed endlessly and i seriously doubt anybody will change their minds . if you are interested in islam i would suggest you find a good imam near you to talk to . many of the internet sites can lead you down the wrong path -LRB- submission.org being one of them -RRB- . <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> <strong> i refuse to drink the kool-aid ! </strong> -- <em> pm </em> </p>
i was a teenager in the us
but maybe it is different for girls because i did not see sex as a sport and did not like the notion of competing with another woman when my heart was involved . i really ca n't relate to what you are saying here . perhaps the painful reality of so many polygynous marriages hits too close to home to me . in fact , i would think that islamic polygyny when practiced properly -LRB- if there is such a thing -RRB- is not supposed to make the women feel in competition with each other . i always thought it places a tremendous burden on men to make sure they are not hurting their wife/wives and make each feel special in her own right -- not compared to the competition . i do n't think most men are able to fulfill that role and i expect to see a lot of `` paralyzed '' men on the day of judgment . moreover , i think it shows a lack of faith that so many take the matter so lightly . it seems to me they are living for earthly pleasure with no concern about accountability . <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> <strong> i refuse to drink the kool-aid ! </strong> -- <em> pm </em> </p>
pm , i was not intending that as a good reason for polygamy ,
but only using it as a perspective through which to view american culture . no . it is cruel for a man to make such a competition between his wives . the same cruelty happens between unmarried people through dating , flirting , etc. it also occurs when someone is flaunting wealth . whatever intentionally provokes negative feelings that harm a person 's contentment and inner peace is a sort of cruelty . this is the reason for the hijab , and also for the prohibition -LRB- only for men -RRB- of wearing gold or silk . part of what i wanted to make noticed is how much of contemporary western consumer society is centered around the drive to provoke such feelings - lust , envy , jealousy , etc. in others about one 's self . the `` if you got it , flaunt it '' mentality . that people in the west are now so addicted to this game , is the reason why they react in such horror at the idea of hijab , especially , as if it nullifies any reason for a woman to live if she does not strut her stuff . so i was only trying to see polygamy through the competition lens to make a point about this cultural trend .
you may be right habib but in the 10 years i have been in qatar
i have witnessed jealousy , envy , greed and materialism on a scale i never knew existed in the west . it really was a shock to my system and while i might have found it curious in the beginning , i now see it as so un-godly it 's hard to even believe you are in the heart of islam . maybe you have n't been here that long . it would be interesting to see how you feel after 10 years . <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> &#160; </p> <p> <strong> i refuse to drink the kool-aid ! </strong> -- <em> pm </em> </p>
well , qatar is a very small place ,
and unique in being the wealthiest nation in the world . it would not be scientific , to say the least , to take observations of qatar , and use that as a measuring stick to judge all of arabs and muslims , much less islam . first , as a muslim you know yourself that there is a wide gap between the ideal of islam , and the current state of muslims . and to spend too much breath defending ourselves as we actually are would be a waste except when it is in defense of truth and fairness . i have enough real faults as it is to put up with kafrs making things up . secondly , yes . if perhaps i think about the small town i grew up in missouri to the wealth of doha , then there is certainly a lot more materialism and greed here . but if i were to compare doha to an equally wealthy place in the u.s. then it would be hard to believe that there is that much more greed here . what there is more of here , but less than in most of the arab world , i think , is monopolization , the sort of nepotism which kills efficiency , an unfortunate emphasis on irrelevant forms of status -LRB- e.g. family and tribal membership -RRB- over quality work and capability , and extremem disparity . none of these are healthy in islamic standards . remember the prophet warned not to be destroyed by what destroyed those who came before - which was that they were strict in punishing the poor but leniant in letting the rich get away with things . he warned but the arabs after some time did not listen . so , it did certainly harm them , and is destroying them , at least socially . still , they are my brothers and i am with them in the same boat ... whether they all acknowledge that or not .
i refuse to believe any 19 -
i refuse to believe any 19 - 25 year old lady would volunteer to marry a 45 to 55 years old guy . this would be highly exceptional and not common . further more it is immoral . impregnating woman at a young age takes away their possibility of proper education/development and such . one hell of a way to keep females ` low ' .

there are so many why
there are so many why questions including this one : -RRB-
it is estimated that the
it is estimated that the oceans formed about 500 million years ago . a lot of the salt entered the oceans during their formative years . as igneous rocks cooled below the oceans , they released a lot of the salt into the oceans . more salt entered the oceans as rock and sediments on the ocean floor dissolved . still more salt entered the ocean through the erosion of the land . as mountains gradually break down and rains wash over the land , naturally occurring salts of the earth are washed into the ocean . as water from the ocean evaporates , the salts are left behind , so the ocean gets more salty with time . http://www.strangequestions.com/question/709/why-is-there-salt-in-the-ocean.html

because all the sealife creatures do susu in it that 's why it is salty ...

french school for non french passport holders
i was thinking about applying for my child to attend frech school in doha but we do n't haold french passports -LRB- only australian and british -RRB- . does anyone have any information about the new french school - i think it is called lycee voltaire . i think lycee bonaparte is only for french passport holders . pleas advise - i 'm really quite desperate for a good school for my child ...
yes , the lycee voltaire does
yes , the lycee voltaire does indeed take non french passport holders . has a good reputation and the parents that i know with children there are very happy with the school . classes tend to be smaller than in the lycee francais as well .

bonapart vs voltaire
as far as bonapart school is concerned it is the official french school in qatar . they take french citizen on a priority list , then french speaking passport holders -LRB- there are some agreement between french speaking contries -RRB- then other on a waiting list . voltaire follows the french cursus , is also sponsored by the french gov. but i am not sure if they hire exclusively french accreditated teachers .
to batrachos
at voltaire school , there is only french `` accreditated '' teachers . no local contract only to teach foreign language and for assistant for kidgarden ... for students , there is 1/3 for qatari 1/3 for french and 1/3 for others . voltaire is also an official french school . 350 students against more than 1000 at bonaparte
how can i ensure that the car is not morgaged ?
hi ! i am going to purchase a used car . the seller is the second owner and the car registration is on his name . how can i ensure that it is not morgaged ? is there any document that can prove this ? let me know please . thanks !
re : how can i ensure that the car is not morgaged ?
just take the car to the salwa road there are many companies which are doing computer checking of the car so like that you can ensure that the car is perfect or there are some faults . . ok thanks !!!
re : how can i ensure that the car is not morgaged ?
if there is a loan , it will be printed on the road permit card -LRB- estimara -RRB- if not , there is no legal loan on that car .
re : how can i ensure that the car is not morgaged ?
no no no its on the registration card , that is true , but what is written there , is cash : that means -LRB- no mortgage -RRB- any other thing but cash : that means its mortgaged -LRB- the name of the mortgage company or bank -RRB- check it out every one when its blank : that means -LRB- some thing is wrong -RRB- if so consult the traffic department
re : how can i ensure that the car is not morgaged ?
well well & well :-RRB- very simple take the car to traffic dept. for owenership change they will not transfer it if its morgaged !!!
any evening nursery ?
does anybody know any evening nursery ? i have a baby 4 moth old and very much in need of childcare just for one evening , 10th november , next monday . dont want to use nanny since i dont know any of them and it is scary to leave baby with a stranger . please help !
do n't understand
what 's the difference between leaving the baby with a nanny who is a stranger or a nursery with a bunch of strangers ? find a friend with a live-in maid that might `` lend '' you the maid for the evening . at least then you would get a trusted reference .
there are no such ` evenin
there are no such ` evenin nursery ' in doha that i know off . most nursery close in the afternoon , i think the latest is busy bees at 3pm -LRB- i might be wrong , you can check it out to clarify -RRB- .
...
dont u have any close friends that you could entrust your baby ? bcos i havent heard of any `` evening nursery '' b4 . even in our country . since most parents come home at night and thats the only time they could spend the time with their children . or at least go to some regular `` daycare centers '' maybe some of them can make special arrangements for you . try it . livin the life

hmc promotions and recruitment
does anyone know when does the promotions and recruitment start in hmc ? is it true that there is no money to give the employees promotion ? is it true that many staff thinks hmc is becoming a less desirable place to work ?
scorpio78 your tag line
`` give the worker his dues , his rights , before his sweat dries '' by the prophet muhammed -LRB- pbuh -RRB- should be pasted in all the management offices at hmc . any sector in hmc which would be left behind would somehow impact on the overall performance . i hope this will be ironed out soon for the benefit of all concerned . =-RRB- __________________________________________________ `` no one is in charge of your happiness except you ''
i absolutely refuse to
i absolutely refuse to believe that this is done because of economical crisis . it is all because of the inexperienced and inefficient administration of hmc . everyday there is some news of buying ultra expensive technology and equipments for hmc , however , they do n't have money to pay their staff . also , they are constantly pressurising staff to perform better than their best . well , all of us know the old saying . pay peanuts and get monkeys to work . hmc will soon turn into a monkey show . and no , nothing is going to change in march 2010 . if there was a real problem , it could be solved . there is no end to fake problems . are you nuts ? ... . no doubt i am crazy about you !
is it true ?
is it true that all promotions for expatriates are stopped for next 2 years as part of cost-cutting by the hospital ? a friend of mine said that , thats the reason why they are giving 1 month bonus to deviate the people 's attention from the worst thats yet to come !
never heard of that issue
never heard of that issue medboy but hopefully not.as far as i know they keep on recruiting nurses and i dont know with other sectors in the hospital.lets wait for 2010 coz they still working this out and inshallah we will get the increment.its hard to hope and expect that far.lets just cross our fingers ...

is it worth buying household items in qatar and take it to india
i am constructing a house in india . wondering whether i can buy house hold items like lcd , split acs , cooking range , furniture etc from qatar and take it to india . if yes what are the suggested items to purchase here . also any reliable sea cargo - door to door service available thanks in advance
re : is it worth buying household items in qatar and take ...
a big no ... u just waste money on shipping ... and u get very good ones in india .
re : is it worth buying household items in qatar and take ...
noooooooo . only few items i found in qatar which has good quality and cheap price compared to india are : - 1 . saffron 2 . gold -LRB- price is almost same but quality is good -RRB-
re : is it worth buying household items in qatar and take ...
dude , it is not good idea to buy house hold items from here , since all the branded stuffs easily available in india with better price & warranty .
re : is it worth buying household items in qatar and take ...
i did that mistake six years ago . dealing with clearing agents at customs , and labourer union at customs yard was a nightmare i will never forget.they suck your blood to the last drop .
re : is it worth buying household items in qatar and take ...
not at all recommended - you get every households at your doorsteps . you could carry some of the best chocolates etc. instead ... which will be cheaper than duty free shops there .
re : is it worth buying household items in qatar and take ...
electronic items are subject to guarantee or warranty . what will you do if something goes wrong with the lcd tv , slit ac , washing machine and cooking range ? if your are buying them from india most of them are with 2-5 years warranty and some are with 1-2 years guarantee . some brands are offering extended warranty by paying some extra money . if something goes wrong you can call the shop where you bought it and they will arrange with the service centre for the necessary action . i know that some products have international warranty but it is not as easy as you are buying something locally in india . further more you will have to spend a lot of money for cargo even if it is by sea .
re : is it worth buying household items in qatar and take ...
good qaulity branded materials will get in india . . these are made in china ...

multi-exit is not parallel to your rp 's validity & vice versa . . both have its own expiry date . if your rp expires and you 've left the country thinking that your mep is still valid , you can not come back , hence , if your mep expires and your rp is still valid you cant leave . .

that way people drink cold water after eating meals ... they dont die ... its just abuse of the system ... ts over the years that it affects the body 's metabolism ... ... like if you dont sleep for 24 hrs you wont die ... and many people skip sleep ... it affects them later on . ayurveda treat the cause not the symptoms ... modern medicine treats the symptom eg : if you are having a headache . . modern medicine practitioners would give you a tablet to stop the ache ... painkiller ... while ayurveda practitioners reach into your body to find the cause ... all in a minute ! jews i guess too avoid milk with meat . its not complete nonsense ... as ayurveda used for treatment of a lot of disease ... and ayurveda doctors scan your body in a minute -LRB- unlike time taking tests modern medicine -RRB- by holding your pulse at 3 points . snessy the info given to you was half true ... food is related to digestion ... nothing to do with patches . . maybe just to scare children ... lol a well trained stomach can even overcome very high levels of poison ... like rasputin did ... its also mentioned in the indian history of chanakya who used to train himself and his king to overcome poison by taking very tiny levels of poison ... and increasing its dosage accordingly ayurveda considers the stomach as the route of all diseases ... more : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ayurveda

cooked yoghurt is ok . but
cooked yoghurt is ok . but eating fish , with plain yoghurt is supposedly not good for your system . something to do with the concept of not mixing `` hot '' and `` cold '' foods .

ayurveda has guidelines about food ...
ayurveda has guidelines about dietary habits ... like : # in the evening avoid heavy foods such as meat , fish , yoghurt , cheese , buttermilk and fromage frais . # avoid eating between meals . instead drink hot water , or if necessary eat ripe sweet fruit . # avoid reheated or stale food . # most of one 's food should be cooked , as the body can more easily absorb cooked food . raw food should be eaten only as a side dish -LRB- e. g. salad -RRB- . # make use of culinary spices . they not only make the food tasty , but support the digestive processes as well . # include all 6 tastes in each meal : sweet , sour , salty , pungent , bitter , and astringent . the tastes also have their own influence on the subtle inner balance of the physiology . # during meals you may sip liquids such as water , juice or lassi . do not drink a lot and avoid ice-cold drinks - they dampen down the digestive processes . # milk should not be drunk with the main meal . it can be taken alone or with a light meal of sweet tasting foods -LRB- e.g. toast , cereals etc -RRB- . minimise food of other tastes . # honey should not be heated above body temperature -LRB- 40 degrees c -RRB- and therefore should not be used in cooking or baking . there is also an exhaustive list on the combination of food which is good and bad .
i only know yoghurt and fish
i only know yoghurt and fish should not be eaten together .

carbohydrate rich food is not combined with acidic food items . eg if you take bread and lemon juice together , it will cause the digestive system to erratically digest both the items . do n't eat grain , cereal or pulses item with acidic items like citrus fruits , grapes , pineapple etc. . protein rich food items go well with low-carb food items like rice and vegetable . vegetables also go well with all types of starchy , carbohydrate rich food items . fruits should ideally be taken as a separate meal , independent of other regular meals . milk and meat is bad combination . never take milk and meat in a single meal . separate intake of milk and meat by at least four hours . milk and meat is good for body in several ways . when taken together , it becomes toxic . many modern food styles fly on the face of this ayurvedic food combination rule . milk is also to be taken warm . cold milk can cause indigestion . taking milk too hot also is not desirable . ending the meals with sweet dessert is not allowed in ayurveda . one needs to end a full-belly meal with some hot and light item like buttermilk . buttermilk is curd diluted with water and added with a pinch of salt , chilly powder , some curry leaves and a bit of ginger . many times ginger and curry leaves are avoided from the combination , only due to difficulty in availability . other factor to keep in mind with ayurvedic food combination includes the endurance of the digestive system . a strong digestive fire -LRB- pitta -RRB- almost over-rides some of the effects associated with unscientific food combination . not all are blessed with such a strong digestive fire . and the most important food rule by ayurveda do n't burden your digestive system by eating too full . over-eating is already a strict no-no , ayurveda suggests you take half-stomach solid food , fill a quarter with water and leave the rest free . this is best for proper digestion .

sponsoring friend to doha
hi ql , my friend in abudabi want to visit me in doha . how do i sponsor visa for them . any prior experices please share .
re : sponsoring friend to doha
hey buddy had to do this myself a month back and here 's what i learned : 1 -RRB- first up , you can normally only sponsor your immediate family or blood relatives on a visit to qatar . what that means is you cant sponsor your friend since he is not related to you . i have heard of some people with special work visas who are able to do so but im guessing you are n't one of them 2 -RRB- now the only option you have is to get a visa through a hotel for your friend . . within this option you have two more options ; you can get a one month tourist visa for a thousand rials but he will have to stay in the hotel which will be expensive . . your second and more feasible option is a business visa through the hotel . . this will however cost you 2000 rials , be valid for three months but the friend can stay with you instead of the hotel . . there 's a few hotels that do this and you could try gulf horizon behind standard chartered bank near the souq waqif/souq asiri area near the corniche . 3 -RRB- now depending on the budget ; if your friend is visiting for long , then the business visa will be expensive but save the expense and hassle of staying in the hotel . but if it 's a short visit then you could inquire about the hotel 's rates for his stay . . so yeah ; i managed to get my buddy into doha because he was ready to pay 2000 for a business visa . . hope you and your buddy can get together and have a great time too . . best of luck buddy : - -RRB-

if you want to intruduce ur chinese food restaurant over here ... then you may need a larger space ... and probably if u open a restaurant ... the rent would be the same as phoenix guessing ...

one bedroom + hall + kitchen + bathroom = ???? rent
i am moving from abu dhabi to doha in april . please someone suggest me what will be one bedroom flat rent . can i get a one bedroom + hall in a villa ? what will be the rent ? i heard rents are on monthly basis ... then will the owner increase the rent when ever he wants by the end of any month ? please guide . thanks in advance .
re : one bedroom + hall + kitchen + bathroom = ???? rent
for one bedroom in villa the range between 5000 to 7500 qr per month the agreement for one year and the increasment will be yearly only .
re : one bedroom + hall + kitchen + bathroom = ???? rent
nothing to worry about finding your choice of accommodation suitable for your budget in qatar , or scared to secure one with key-money as in your uae . just step in to cooperative store or big hyper market , nowadays 100s of advertisements are there looking for people to share it , or rent independantely the apartment for reasonable rate . so you try to keep moving into the cooperative store from location to location so most of the advertisements are found stick on their wall , with contact nos . and you can manage to get one without any difficulty approx . not morethan 4000 / - a best one .
re : one bedroom + hall + kitchen + bathroom = ???? rent
it depends on the location you will be assigned . one-bedroom + hall villa will cost ranging from qr 4,000.00 to qr 5,000.00 . rent increase here is freezed for 2 years effective february 15 , 2008 as per municipal law / notice . you should have a written agreement with you as to be sure that such tenant-landlor relationship / contract is registered at municipality .
re : one bedroom + hall + kitchen + bathroom = ???? rent
4500 - 7000 range for one bedroom appartment/villa . rent will increase yearly only .
conditions for getting a noc
hello all . i am currently interviewing for a nanny . we found someone who we would like to employ , but she said that her current employer will only give her a noc -LRB- no objection certificate -RRB- if she or i pay them 6000 riyals ??? she has worked for them for 4 years . can i still employ her without the noc ? . i do n't think its fair that they are asking for 6000 qar ... . any help/advise will be greatly appreciated . thanks
why would n't you contact the
why would n't you contact the sponsor and talk to him/her ? are you sure that the sponsor demans the money ?
spoke to the sponsor
i called and spoke to the sponsor . they paid 7000qar for her 4 years ago . they want that money back !
i put my adverts on every
i put my adverts on every grocery store also here in qatar living and check adverts everywhere such as newspapers , grocery advertisement board and also here in ql ! i never approach any agency as my friends used to get their maids from agencies and end up with lots of expenses but if there 's anything goes wrong with the maids they are obligued to replaced them but it will be additional expenses for you . the easiest way for you to do is apply for a maid visa depending on the nationalities you prepared and when visa is approved , then you can start searcing for the right candidate locally who are looking for an employer who can give them visa . otherwise , there are also free-lancers , who do not need sponsorship but of course you have to give them weekend day off as they are not under your sponsorship , you are less in control of the situation . i had phobia sponsoring maids as they tend to jump off the ship and get into trouble with cid . so in the end i just hire free-lancers ! it may not be cheaper but less headache ! ; -RRB-
7000 should be amortized over
7000 should be amortized over 4 years . . :-RRB- to be honest , do n't know what to suggest . . i wouldnt go the way jjh is suggesting ... puting the ads in the grocery stores to get a nanny for your kids is n't the best way to hire a good companion for them . . 6000 is a high price . . on the other hand if you go through the agency , it wo n't be much cheaper . . you just have to come to conclusion that having a nanny is n't cheap . . and pay the fee ...
jjh , there is no such thing
jjh , there is no such thing in qatar like free-lancer . you are violating the law and encourage other people -LRB- your `` free-lancers '' -RRB- to violate the law ... that 's what must bring you a headache , not sponsoring them . .
your experience is illegal .

how will that help ?
hi . i am south african ... . how will this exchange work ? the person i want to employ will still need the noc , ?? i want to avoid paying such a vast sum of money ... please explain !
noc should not cost you !
there are lots of maid looking for a job do n't stick to the one you know ! most sponsor are opportunist ! if they see an opportunity they will demand , although they want to get rid of their maid they want to make money in the last minute ! i release my maids at no cost ! especially those who are troublesome ! worse comes to worst you will pay for that amount and the maid is a troublesome ! so how can you get your expenses back ? if they are good worker the employer will keep them and will not try to make money in order to release them ! they only demand because they think they have waste a lot of money employing her !
employed for 4 years !
she has been employed with her current sponsor for 4 years and the previous sponsor for 5 years all here in doha and was in kuwait before that . i definitely do not think that her current sponsor wasted their money ... she spent an hour with us and played with my son . we were very happy with the way she spoke and conducted herself . if she does not get her noc then will she have to leave the country ?? is there any way in which i can avoid paying the 6000 qar ? thanks

once it is in the traffic
once it is in the traffic police system and is shared with the other govt . agencies like immigration and border control ; if your car is outside of uae already you will either have to pay the next time you enter with the same car , or if you are still there you will need to pay on exit .

tourist visa
can anybody help me.i went to the airline to book a ticket for my friends wife they refuse to do the booking cos her validity of the passport is up to july 1st 2011 they told me that her passport has to be valid for 6month the day she is travelling from doha not from india cos she is holding a tourist visa , is it true.if she renew her passport the passport number will change.the visa will not be valid.can someone give me the suggestion or help .
re : tourist visa
sir , he made it through hotel and when i went to book they refuse now when i call one friend of mine in the embassy he told there is no law unless the passport is still valid she can travel .
re : tourist visa
just go to ministry of labor in mutazah beside american hospital , bring the new passport of your friend and the visa copy . first go to reception counter ask for a number and tell about your concern . wait for your turn , if you meet the lady just ask her to change the passport number in the visa . on the following day you will see the result in the net . i did that also to my daughter just 2 months ago .
opening a nursery ???
i am a canadian citizen and a certified kindergarten teacher with teaching experience in the united states and canada . i was thinking about opening a nursery and kindergarten in doha . i would like to know where to start from ; the legalities and the capital needed . your advice and observations are welcome .
re : opening a nursery ???
kinder garden , i dont know whether the legal formalities for a non profit organization and profit organization is the same.but usually , if you have to start a company , you need a minimum capital of qar 200,000 / - which can be withdrawn after the commencement of business.before the company gets registered , you need to hire a villa/office or what ever.find a good sponsor as well . good luck !
re : opening a nursery ???
no idea but i think u need to have a good place a qatari sponser and all the requirements and a big large sum

i hope it answers your query
flying with your pet faqair travel for animals can be tricky and dangerous business , so it is important to know what the law , the airlines , and veterinarians recommend . questionshow do i know if air travel is appropriate for my pet ? what steps should i take prior to a flight to make sure my pet 's trip goes smoothly and safely ? can my pet travel in the cabin of the airplane , rather than in the cargo hold ? what does the law require me to do if my pet is going to travel in the plane 's cargo hold ? answerhow do i know if air travel is appropriate for my pet?not all pets can or should travel by plane . air travel is stressful for pets , so you should consider a number of factors before deciding to transport your pet on an airplane , including your pet 's disposition , age , breed and health . heat or pregnancy . animals who are in heat or who are pregnant should not travel by plane . age . federal law requires that animals be at least eight weeks old and fully weaned -LRB- meaning weaned for at least five days -RRB- before they travel in the cargo hold of a plane . although the law does not say so , veterinarians generally recommend against putting elderly pets through the discomfort of air travel . breed . pug-nosed animals should never travel in the cargo hold of a plane . this is because of the structure of their faces , which may inhibit their breathing during air travel . if your dog is of one of the breeds listed below , be sure to discuss the issue with your veterinarian and with the airline . many airlines will not accept pug-nosed animals for air travel . the following dogs are considered to be pug-nosed : american staffordshireenglish toy spanieldutch pugshih tzustaffordshire bull terrierbrussels griffinpekineseboston terrierenglish bulldogjapanese pug , andjapanese spaniel .

inigo
im a boxing coach in qatar . i mean a genuine boxing coach not someone who has done a two day course and sets themselves up as a coach . i met inigo by chance and we have ended up as friends . he comes to my two weekly classes at the intercon city and when i 'm away covers them . he is a fantastic coach , one of the best ive worked with . genuine muay thai passion with great teaching . i never let anyone cover my boxing classes except inigo because he knows boxing very well also . if you want to learn genuine muay thai then i would highly recommend him . also for boxing , swimming and tennis . the guy is a legend !
muy thai

i got an job offer for 7000 qr without accomodation and other transport facilities , can i take the offer
my kids studying state board education in 6 th and 3 rd standard , maharastra india my wife is ma eng lit bed , can i shift them and what are the fees and possibilities for my wife get an teacher job at doha and my kids joining school . me presently working in a logistics company earning 30,000 inr .
re : i got an job offer for 7000 qr without accomodation ...
for 7000k you ca n't survive here . think before making further move . good luck !
re : i got an job offer for 7000 qr without accomodation ...
this offer kind of ok if they provide u family accomodation .
re : i got an job offer for 7000 qr without accomodation ...
you will spent minimum 3500qr for your accomodation -LRB- partitioned villa 1bhk ... managable space !!! -RRB- , for 4 people you will have a grocery bill around 1500qr per month . then your childrens studies etc etc. . . if your company will give you family accomodation , transport its ok . . you can think about it !!
re : i got an job offer for 7000 qr without accomodation ...
that 's hard , for having 2 kids , u need accomodation not less than 3500 qr/month other than the cost of living , may be that can be accpetable if ur wife found a job this is applicable but not guarnteed
re : i got an job offer for 7000 qr without accomodation ...
now v r here in qatar in the same condition with 2 kids and same salary , , but no savings , , so please c for any other good chances , , besst of luck , , ,
re : i got an job offer for 7000 qr without accomodation ...
sharing accomodation : 3000 - 3500 qr grocery : 1000 - 1500 qr school fees : 1250 - 1750 qr conveyance : 1250 - 1500 qr from the above figures you can decide whether it is worth taking the offer .
re : i got an job offer for 7000 qr without accomodation ...
no way ... the offer is not good for supporting a family ... one fully furnished 1bhk flat will go not below qar 5000 / - ... this offer could be still considerable if the company provides you with a family accomodation + qr 7000 . thats the most expensive thing here ... negotiate with the company or else wait for better opportunity ...

if i am an american national and my fiance is yemeni can we get married if i come to qatar on a tourist visa ?
can i live in qatar with him after we marry ? instead of me staying in a hotel am i alowwed to stay at his flat if he stays in a hotel until we make the marriage contract ? what will we need to do ?
re : if i am an american national and my fiance is yemeni ...
legally speaking you are not allowed to live together without being married and if caught can be deported . and you can not get married without a resident visa in doha . so better get married outside first , get a visa and come to doha . once married you can live together . no problem .
re : if i am an american national and my fiance is yemeni ...
emily - i just checked with my colleague here and here is what he had to say . he said you can not marry in qatar without a letter from your father giving you permission to marry and it should be attested in the us . also you need to have 3 of your own witnesses .
re : if i am an american national and my fiance is yemeni ...
it 's cheaper to marry in las vegas !
re : if i am an american national and my fiance is yemeni ...
you both need a residency permit to be married in qatar . you will not get one since you are not employed and can not be sponsored by a fianc . you will have to be married elsewhere - if indeed , that is wise .
re : if i am an american national and my fiance is yemeni ...
hi emily , are you in yemen now ? is it because of the hassle of getting married to a foreigner ? i am british and married a yemeni woman . it was a real headache to get the paperwork done and took a lot of time . i considered leaving yemen and getting married abroad , too , but it really is not possible . an american i knew in yemen took his wife -LRB- to be -RRB- to egypt to get married , but once he got back to yemen , i heard that the authorities did not deem the marriage legal and he had to go through the whole process . -LRB- this is what i heard , but i can not be 100 % sure . -RRB- i am not sure of your situation , but can totally sympathise with you , as the whole process took me two years to complete . i had my uk paperwork done in 3 months , it was the yemeni side which took forever ! i do n't think it is possible for you to get married outside of yemen unless you take your fiancee to the states , where you should be able to get it done . but then again , visas to the us for yemenis are not so easy to come by . wish you luck . aq
re : if i am an american national and my fiance is yemeni ...
you can try the american embassy in qatar and do the registration certificate which should be ok and official , check the us embassy in doha .

-LRB- iam also an indian -RRB- dear sir / madam first of all i would like to say you that you are a chutiya / person because : 1 . -RRB- you are here in the middle east for carrier-happiness or to entertain 3rdclass politicss . 2 . -RRB- have you ever heard this kind of meaningless topic or question by an european/us or any other asian country guy . 3 . -RRB- stop bothering your self , focus upon your family . 4 . -RRB- i hope you are a -LRB- indian -RRB- malbaari & because of you people & your cheap behaviours other indian 's are considered as 3rd class citizens , here in the middle east .
re : where i hve to apply for vote next indian election
my guess is `` at the embassy '' -LRB- !? -RRB- regards !!
re : where i hve to apply for vote next indian election
dear trad.cont. , you ca n't be so rude in your response . after all he is also an indian , it hurts me being a malabari as you said . you need to learn a lot from them to become an indian first .
re : where i hve to apply for vote next indian election
dear trad . cont . i feel sorry and shame on you , as an indian do you know what is democracy and value of right to vote ... democracy has become even more important in the present scenario.democracy is said to be the rule of majority and majority should have the authority otherwise there would be serious consequences . when the basic rights of people are denied then they become livid and do n't give respect to the rights of others . that 's why violence is on rise . in democracy people decide who will govern and who will rule . if the democracy is established in its true form and the institutions are strengthened so that every one is accountable for what he had done , the world will be a better place for living . in democracy access to justice is equal for every one and no one can snub the rights of others . rule of law is insured and hence people respect each other 's rights.in today 's world terrorism and extremism are on rise . suicide attacks have threatened everyone and the basic reason is injustice . when innocent people are denied of their rights they do not remain innocent any more . when people are not given respect then they do n't care for the respect of others . this is the point where democracy becomes important as it protects the rights of the people , and in order to establish democracy you should have voting rights . come on wake up trad.cont . you are in 2011 , do n't be a fool of your self ... . .

re : can pakistan girls allow marry indian ????
are you asking can a pakistani girl marry an indian or vice versa ? yes they can surely do , however getting visa and settling down in pakistan is much easier if the girl is from pakistan . and you will find it very hard to get the visa process in india if you are taking your pakistani wife to india permanently .

what defines beauty ?
what are the physical traits which contribute to on being beautiful ? what are the key parameters ? i wonder how some people look so beautiful/handsome and some do n't !
i do n't agree with all these
i do n't agree with all these sorry poknat . ugly women say the beauty is internal ! bullshit there is beautiful and ugly ! -LRB- i 'm mathematician -RRB- ugly women should accept it that 's all and avoid over makeup because that will make here look uglier .
how do you define ugliness or
how do you define ugliness or beauty ?
physical traits ?
- symetry is a sine qua non quality to be beautifull/harmonious . - color -LRB- white teeth , red lips , eyes , one-color hair ... -RRB- - cleanliness -LRB- hair well done , skin , teeth ... -RRB- - smell - sound -LRB- voice -RRB- - size/ratios -LRB- chest-waist-hips -RRB- - forms -LRB- long neck , face shape , hair , dress . . -RRB-
beauty ... ^ ^
the standard of beauty is not definite , you define it . it is how you carry yourself in the face of all the people , situation surrounding you . for you , how do you define beauty ? everyone here has a word to say about beauty and if that is there personal view about the topic than so be it ... ^ ^
beauty is as unique as every individuals imaginative mind !
beauty is a very big word that most people do not understand and easily mis-interprete most times . have you ever wondered why some find tall ladies pretty and others think petite ladies make the world go round ? and why do some like light skin tone and others will go anywhere around the world just to have a darker skin tone ?? or why do some people simply just get bored of the beauty queen the married recently ? its because , beauty is a combination of desirable physical , moral and intellectual qualities . physical beauty is a combination of qualities like shape of body , color -LRB- light or dark tone of skin , hair , eyes not necesarily ethnic background -RRB- and form so that it causes a pleasing effect on the beholders senses . the right mix of this differs from person to person . its better known as pretty in females and handsome in males or good looking in general . moral beauty is influenced by culture and traditions -LRB- also religion -RRB- of the locality . and moral beauty qualities includes modesty , comportment , respect , charisma , cleanliness and others . intellectual beauty is wisdom or practical use of knowledge . we can see that , though it is not wrong , most people judge beauty based on the physical only , but this is just a part of beauty called `` looks '' and is only skin - deep , not the total beauty . a true and total beauty is a person that has a reasonable amount of the physical , moral and intellectual beauty . this is the standard used for most beauty pageants , but offcourse , the moral and intellectual part is usually played low . your grandma can be a moral and intellectual beauty but not a looker ! ... atleast not anymore . ;-RRB- . what might be beautiful to one is not to the other since everyone has a different standard of measure , but can agree on a general level . on a final note , since physical beauty can tarnish with time , timelesss beauty can be said to be the inner moral and intellectual beauty of any person . everyone can be beautiful , ... without surgery . think about it .

traffic news on the radio ?

there was a day when they were playing some ass-boring music and then this british guy , with a strange voice -LRB- bernie -RRB- said he got tired of getting sms criticizing his musical choices , and that he did not care and therefore he would continue playing the same ole-same ole . that was the day when i stopped listening to this grap !
channel 4 from dubai
on 104.8 mhz is also sometimes receivable . but all the long distance fm channels seem to have gone in the last few days with the arrival of autumn ? must be a heat/humidity thing that allows us to receive them in summer .
i thought bernie is irish ?
that 's what was said on that radio station when one of the announcer -LRB- forgot his name -RRB- negated that him and bernie sounded alike .
if dubai and bahrain fm radio
if dubai and bahrain fm radio stations are received clearly in qatar then who would listen to 97.5 ?
exactly
just like the local newspapers you would probably get very little information worth listening to on this station . perhaps try tuning to the french service of qbs
its there in the arabic
its there in the arabic service .
why would they report traffic
why would they report traffic news ? it 's the same reason why weather reporting is not big business . the report would be -- heavy congestion at every round about , multiple accents , crazy drivers in little pick-ups , aggressive drivers in lcs and large trucks generally being moronic . in other words , it 's lethal out there so drive something large and pray a lot .
the truth is simple but
the truth is simple but seldom ever seen . qbs is n't a ` news channel ' ! it 's an amateur radio station and serves as an alibi . do n't expect anything and you 'll be fine .

doha school places september 2012
hi everyone , my husband has just got a job with qatar airways and i 'm hoping to get my three children into a british school in doha in september 2012 , i need a place in year 3 , year 2 and reception . can anybody advise on how likely that is ? i 'm not sure if i should stay in the uk until i can get the children into a school or could that be a really long wait ??? any information would be greatly received , many thanks xx
my personal advice
wait and only apply to doha english speaking school . if they get accepted then leave the uk . this school is only british school which follow the actual british curriculum and is monitored by the british educational council . all the rest of the british school claim they `` follow '' the british curriculum . who is there to monitor the school ? if you pay for a private company to accredit the school , they will come out and give you accreditation . you will find out that your child will be a year behind because majority of the schools do n't have the textbooks for each subject in the class . nor do they have a curriculum without textbooks or manuals . sadly , the teachers have to deal with the parents as to why their child is behind because the principal will pond you over to the teacher for any complaints .
dess although the best has
dess although the best has longgggg waiting list and is until primary . for me , no harm putting them into the waiting list & pray that you will get a place . to me there are other good ones like doha college , parkhouse , sherbourne & doha british school which you can consider . due to personal preference , i have seen parents transferring their kids within these few schools too . alternatively you let your husband settled here first . . find a school before you guys come over . all schools require entrance exam before they are accepted . so whenever a place becomes available , do prepare to fly them immediately .
apply now
its not easy to find school seat available in doha so i strongly suggested to apply now . newton british school and montessori british school are the best following british curriculum and the best location -LRB- al waab/al azizya -RRB- for western people to live . good luck angelo
any place you can get is
any place you can get is good . apply to at least 6 schools and keep your fingers crossed . it might take up to 2 years
to me , whether you are
to me , whether you are coming with your husband a not , you have to start applying now & wait for schools to come back to you with a place . as of now , i can say all schools brit or non brit are on waiting list mainly due to 2 reasons 1 . influx of new families coming to doha to work while the existing ones are still here . 2 . existing people are transferring schools to their desired schools or so called better schools . so for schools like doha college & dess would have super long list . heard that there are people waited for 2 years to get into dess . nevertheless , do n't get upset over this as i believe they picked the names by random & also by academic results . so all u need to do is first to submit yr apps & pray that you get picked for an entrance exam . and do n't worry about the entrance exam . it 's very easy and nothing that ordinary kids can not do.another thing that you need to do is to call them up periodically to check for spaces available after you have submitted them . last but not least , if you really have to come here with your hb , take whichever school that can offer you place & wait for your desired on to be available . tat 's what everyone did here in doha actually .
thank you bral1960 !
thank you bral1960 !
entrance exams ...
thank you , minie ... that was a very useful post ... i was worried about the entrance exam , my boys are straight a student 's at thier current school , but i did n't know what the doha schools would expect of them ? i 'm hoping that the exam 's are sat in a nice environment and the children do n't feel any pressure , i want the whole move to qatar to be positive , so fingers crossed , sarah xxx
hi redline , my husband got a
hi redline , my husband got a job for qa as well and we are moving to doha in may ! we are on the same boat !!!! the best think to do is to apply now for all the schools.newton british school might have a place for your children ... just start with any school you can find and then wait for your desired school ! good luck !!!!
your husband can apply for
your husband can apply for the kids while you and them wait in the uk . if there is no movement on the waiting list then obviously you do n't want to give up their places in the uk . to be fair it is probably harder to get your kids into a good public school in the uk than dess . people are coming and going from qatar as there is only so much time you can spend here . the quality of dess is ok , but the teachers do tend to concentrate on the better kids . there is also considerable bias and confidentially can also be breached . codes of conduct and ethics are more relaxed here .
thanks for that , we will see
thanks for that , we will see how thing 's shape up ...
schools
my husband also works for qatar airways . now is an excellent time to apply for schools here as they are sorting places for sept 2012 . i am a teacher and it was a worry trying to get our daughter into a school . we arrived at the wrong time of year and it took a while to get her into a school so i had to home teach for a while . however , this time last year we got our daughter into doha college . she has come on in leaps and bounds and we are thrilled with the school . the school has recently been inspected and did extremely well . they use the british curriculum so the transition from uk to doha college was very easy ! your children will need to sit an assessment but it 's nothing to worry about . you will also need previous school reports from their current uk school . other schools that we were impressed with were dess and sherbourne . hope that helps ! good luck ! : -RRB-
schools
i disagree with expatemily -LRB- i am a friend in real life with her -RRB- park house is a great school . also loads of qatar airway people . i have 3 kids in the school . other good schools -LRB- based on my dealings with the schools and friends comments -RRB- are doha -LRB- montisori -RRB- british school ; doha collage , doha english speaking school . these four schools are also `` reasonably '' priced . the american schools are crazy expensive . i suggest applying to all of those schools now -LRB- as in today ! -RRB- . places often open up over the summer and park house requires a deposit on next year from current students in may for september so you could still easily get places . having 3 children is an advantage because one one gets a place it tends to bounce the others up on the waiting list .
who 's school is best
everytime i log on here and see comments about schools i chuckle at the amount of best schools that are listed . to date i believe there might be about 6 `` best '' schools in doha , based on what , usually perception based on how well a particular child is doing at that school at that moment . it seems to me that if a child is struggling or not doing particulalry well then first thing to do is blame the school `` it must be the school '' . a well motivated pupil will thrive in most environments and from what i have come across so far most of the schools are okay , as long as they are not for profit ... we are never going to replicate a top british school but why would we want to as one of the benefits here is the multi culturalism . of course places are tight but i dont think people should stress as much about the schools . i have a child of 13 who will either go to dbs or dc but personally i would have him in asd -LRB- no chance -RRB- but not because the rest are rubbish just because i personally got a better feeling about the ethos of the school .
i agree with john ...
everybody reckons their school is the best ! my kids -LRB- year 7 & year 5 -RRB- go to dbsm and i have no knowledge of such large class sizes nor any deviation from the british curriculum - a friend of mine teaches there and she is clear that what they teach is the same as home ? they kids recieved excellent text books and stuff . there are horror stories about most of the schools mentioned above -LRB- prob including dbsm ! -RRB- and as many `` best '' schol tags for the same schools - it is down to personal preference and experience .
thank you ... ...
thank you everyone for your quick reply 's , i 'm going to start applications today to all the schools and hope for the best xxx
hi , my kids go to dbs as
hi , my kids go to dbs as well , year 2 , 3 and 5 none of the classes are overcrowded all have around 24 per class - they do follow the british corriculem and would go as far to say they are a year ahead of the kids in england .
best of luck with you school
best of luck with you school applications , i have heard all the british schools are full even for september so would recommend not coming out until you have places for all of them at the same school .
not strictly true , they are

becareful if you have gifted
becareful if you have gifted children , places like park house , newton etc are not able to provide any additional support and your child will not make any progress
gifted children
be careful if you have children , simonsmithy , because your child will not have much support and not make any progress without dedicated teachers and a school with good facilities . the truly gifted children in doha are those who have been given the gift of a place at a decent school . can you please tell me the name of a school in doha that does not have entrance tests ? and why do they have entrance tests , simonsmithy ? all schools have entrance tests in order to keep out children with special educational needs . in this respect , park house is no better or worse than any other school .
i know kids who have got into
i know kids who have got into dess without entrance tests - just reports . same for sherborne , phes , newton etc . all based on uk reports and no tests
entrance tests
you are mistaken , simonsmithy . most children who are trying to gain a place at most schools in doha have to sit some sort of entrance test . i know the lady who arranges the tests at one of the newton schools , so i know that , as usual , you have got your facts wrong . perhaps some children who do come from `` prominent '' schools in the uk might not have to be put through a test , but these are exceptions rather than the rule .
i think it 's best not to
i think it 's best not to accept anything but your preferred school , the transition from the childs home country school is hard enough but to have to then go and uproot them again after they 've made friends and settled in is n't really fair on the child . please do n't despair with my comments just trying to be realistic , it 's your decision at the end of the day . doha is great by the way and you and your family will love it once you 're all out here and settled .
dc and dess ... ...
thank you for your comments ... . dc and dess are my two favourite school 's and i have applied for both ... i have no idea if i have any chance at all at getting them in any time soon ???? sarah xxx
ps michelle , i totally agree
ps michelle , i totally agree with only putting my children into one school and not changing them to my preferred choice when a place become available . my children will already have to leave all thier friends behind in the uk and i do n't want to make them do it again once in doha . sarah xxx
thanks simon , you have to
thanks simon , you have to try though , maybe more chance with sherbourne ? sarah
i have registered for park
i have registered for park house this year and they told me that they received over 600 applications in 2 days . however , i just applied online anyhow . they came back to me & told me that my kids are unlikely to be selected due to the long wait list . anyhow you can try . prob you have better luck . you only change school if you are not happy with the school for whatever the reason is .
possible solution
as a possible short term solution you could try cedars . we had our child enrolled there for a couple of terms whilst we were on a waiting list for another school . as an australian family we had additional problems because our academic year does n't match up with the uk system . the standard of teaching is excellent -LRB- almost all teachers are british -RRB- and the class sizes are small . to be honest , if if was n't for the fact that their building is too small to offer pe etc. we would have left our child enrolled there . anyway , just a thought . i know from experience how frustrating the whole schooling situation is here . good luck .

newton is british ?
i am sorry , tracy.c.marriott , but i do not understand . are you suggesting that newton international schools - there are in fact three schools , not one - are british schools and that they are not in fact `` international '' schools ? or that they only employ british teachers ? or that they follow the english national curriculum , even though arabic and islamic studies are not actually part of the english national curriculum ? or maybe that all of the students are british ? what exactly are you saying ?
tracy , is bullying part of nis curriculum ?
not of the children though !
wow ! how to turn a helpfull
wow ! how to turn a helpfull answer into something it is ` ant . well done all i was trying to say is i know the headmaster , the school has 500 places , i believe it to follow the british curriculum . i gave the web address so anyone wishing to know more , could look .

redline944 there is a brand new international school that most people do n't yet know about - compass international school , al khor . it opened this past january . it follows the british curriculum and the ipc . the classes are capped at 22 students . if you live at the pearl , it is an easy 25 minute drive up to al khor , and the school offers bus service from the pearl and zig zag towers . i can say quite truthfully that the british curriculum is followed with fidelity because i am one of the teachers there . i love it , and so do the other staff and the students . the teachers there live to teach , and the students are engaged and thriving . i do n't mean to sound sales-y but i am quite passionate about our little slice of qatar ! feel free to ask me any questions . www.cisalkhor.com
my husband and i are moving
my husband and i are moving to doha very shortly . we are waiting for our visas to be issued and are hoping to come over mid-october . we have 3 children , they will be going into years 5 , 4 and 2 in september here in the uk . a lot of people have suggested putting their names down for schools from now however we are a bit confused as to whether this is possible given that we do not have our visas , residence permits etc as yet . do the schools accept applications without the kids actually being resident in doha ? what do you advise ? we are very keen on moving as a family , however , although we 're not too fussy , from previous experience i am not keen on home-schooling : - -RRB-
school choices
we went through a similar experience recently where we had to choose a school for our son . we read many stories and received advice ; all very confusing . so we visited the schools that had availability and chose the one that we felt was most suitable after interviewing the headmaster . i think it is beneficial to have your children with you in doha when school-hunting . the entrance tests will need to be undertaken if there is a place available . my son is enrolled at newton international lagoon -LRB- he is 15 yrs old -RRB- and we are looking forward to the opportunity he has and face it with a positive attitude . i trust you find a school that has availability and that resonates with you and your family .

re : where can i find acai berry in doha ?
<strong> hi there ! my name is dana , and i am from bahrain . i read this post and followed the advice of jamesarl & bmw528 and ordered some acai berry to doha over the internet . i just wanted to share my experience with you . i ordered 5 bottles of acai berry health supplement , and it took 6 days to arrive at my office . from : www.acaiberryboutique.com i took the supplements to my physician and doctor , she also uses the same supplement -LRB- acai berry pure -RRB- for her health . she had never ordered online , instead she used to buy them when she was in the us or have friends bring them over . she compared the stuff i got from the acai berry boutique -LRB- the online store -RRB- to the stuff she got in stores in the states , and she said the quality was much better from the online store . we both read a lot of blogs and articles before buying online . there are lots of ways to check quality -LRB- color , taste , feel , texture , density etc -RRB- and my doctor said the online stuff was significantly better . she is also recommending it to her patients now for things like joint pain , inflammation , digestive system , and healthier body shape . i would also recommend you buy the product online , because it is higher quality than what you can get in stores here , and in most places in the states . they ship very quickly for a site located in america , and the prices are very good for such a supplement . thank you jameearl and bmw528 for your recommendation . www.acaiberryboutique.com was an excellent place to buy acai berry ! <strong>

re : where can i find acai berry in doha ?
http://www.officialwire.com/main.php?action=posted_news&rid=148624 acai berry scam : dark side of online marketing consumers losing money not weight , the truth about acai berries is now exposed for the masses acai berry has been known to have countless health benefits but with no relevant data to support the fact . despite the lack of data , modern day people have embraced acai berries as their next best thing to lose weight and gain a healthy body , skin and digestive system . but the truth is that acai berry benefits are overrated . acai palm , derived from the euterpe genre of palm cultured in the brazilian rain forests is known to have antioxidant properties , which is true . but the antioxidants need to be as good for health as it is presented to the common man . also , as acai berry is not directly consumed by human beings , more than half the beneficial properties of the fruit go in vain . after processing and converting the berries into supplements , it is presented in the form of dietary pills , concentrated juices , beverages , instant drinks , smoothies , yoghurts or is eaten whole as a fruit . when taken as a whole fruit , the benefits are genuine , but not otherwise . acai berry scam has been exposed today because of the scientific data that reveals that there has not been any research or investigation about the claimed benefits of the fruit . producers of acai supplements have presented unproven claims and declarations to people about the health benefits of the fruit and its antioxidant properties , but these are all unsubstantial claims . the truth is that acai berries have only very negligible amounts of antioxidant , which is quite less than what you can find in other types of berries and fruits . it needs to be brought to light that there are no such benefits of acai berries that scientists could have pointed out . acai berry and products made from the same have not earned an approval from the fda , and the potency of these products is questionable . there have been many talk shows and conferences regarding the false claims of acai berry as a weight loss supplement , yet people are simply reluctant to acknowledge the fact that acai berries are simply not acceptable according to medical and scientific terms . many consumers of acai products have actually suffered from health complication in the recent past . it should be considered as awareness for the masses , as acai berry products have almost flooded the market today . despite the warnings and acai berry scams revealed on the internet every other day , still there seems to be a lack of communication that needs to be bridged . internet has had a great influence in marketing acai berry products . however , it has also contributed in revealing the acai berry scams , which people have often overlooked . as companies come up with potential free trail offers , customers fall prey to these lucrative offers and accept them . in the quest to try out these products , they often end up endangering their health . acai berries does not have any miraculous properties ; it is just like any other fruit that has not been researched or scientifically tested to have any medicinal properties . the only presence of antioxidants does not make it a weight loss product as well . hence , prevention is advised . for further information on this , you can see : http://www.acaiberry-info.com/acaiberry_scams.htm

i got my acai berry in 5 business days from this online site - acai berry boutique . i definitely recommend it to others wanting this supplement in qatar . the stuff you get at supermarkets and gnc is junk here compared to this online site . even take a look at the content , you will see its only less than 10 % , but online site has pure acai berry capsules , with 100 % extract concentration . results come much faster . i recommend it to others .

hello . . if you have qnb account , you can apply for master e card.qnb offers its customers a secure way to shop online . the mastercard e-card has been specifically designed to allow only internet transactions . it can not be used at atms and pos terminals at shops . qnb mastercard e-card is issued as supplementary card to the main credit card with a lower credit limit . enjoy your online shopping once you get this . .
re : any alternative mode of online payment except credit ...
in cbq they are offering virtual card .
re : any alternative mode of online payment except credit ...
some banks also offer a pre-paid internet shopping card . functions more like a debit card than a credit card , becuase you purchase the card in a set amount and then spend it via internet purchases , rather than having a credit limit . i know for sure that doha bank did this last year , and i have heard that other banks do as well . at doha bank you needed to be an account holder . hope this help .
re : any alternative mode of online payment except credit ...
go for doha bank inernet card i m using it.its good and secure
re : any alternative mode of online payment except credit ...
credit cards should not be used online to make purchases . prepaid internet cards in qatar are issued to only those people who already have a credit card even if you have an account with the bank . why it should be linked to `` credit '' when the payment is `` prepaid '' ? beats me .

how do we improve std of education ? ...
my children did n't get good results this time from board exam . in bfps results are pathetic . because , lady principal send good qualified teacher to pakistan . she is doing trial and error experiments with our children 's future . how do we improve std of our childrens education ?
i do n't want to be harsh but
i do n't want to be harsh but parent are equally responsible for inculcating proper educational values in a child . parent should be more involved with the education of the child even if they are busy . qatar is a place where you can not rely completely on the teaching staff and tutoring the child is quite expensive . unless the child is exceptionally talented he/she needs parental guidance .

i agree with mom_me
i agree with mom_me here ... no school is either good or bad and yes there may be good and bad teachers given that in this part of the world its very diff to get qualified and experienced teachers as they are paid peanuts . but that being said we as parents are also in many ways responsible for the education of our children . just studying the lessons in school arent enough . when they come home see that they revise their work everyday and do their home work on their own . guide them properly and give them good books to read to expand their knowledge . a teacher only guides the child . and if the teacher has not explaind the chapter well or you feel the child needs more then try to do the same at home or hire a tutor to help your child . that being said - every child has their limitations . we shudnt expect our children to perfom miracles nor bring in 100 % results all the time . just encourage your child to do better than the last time every time he sits for an exam and try not to create any panic or tension . every exam shud be approached with a cool head and dont encourage your child to memorize . teach them to understand the subject and study . that not only creates an interest but retention power is more .

how good is rising star kindergarten ?
hi everyone , please i would like to know from personal experiences how good rising star kindergarten is . a friend told me all they do is watch tv all day . i went there during the holidays to check and i actually saw tv 's in the class but i would like to know from anyone whose kids have been to rsk their personal experiences . i really do appreciate your sincere and candid opinions .
re : how good is rising star kindergarten ?
<p> hi rising stars kindergarten is excellent ! i think you have beeen misinformed by your friend regarding the children watching tv all day . children who arrive early before classes commence are supervised in the tv room . at the end of the day children go to the tv room if they have not been picked up on time ! parents appreciate this service as there is no extra charge.you say you went to check in the holidays and every class has a tv in it . i do n't know which kindergarten you visited but it certainly was not rising stars . the only tv is in the tv room . during the holidays a summer camp was in progress ! i invite you to visit rising stars anytime then please post a valid and truthful comment . </p>
re : how good is rising star kindergarten ?
<p> really surprised to hear this comment , my son goes to rsk and he has really excelled since we enrolled him there . they have only one tv room like any other kindergarten , so i do not understand where `` tv 's '' come from ? </p> <p> i think you have been misinformed !! </p>
re : how good is rising star kindergarten ?
hello , my daughter went to this kindergarten and it was appalling , they have one tv room . however , it seems the teachers leave the children there . i did not like this kindergarten at all , there are no british teachers . i tried to communicate with the manager who smelt like she had been smoking , her mannerism was very unprofessional . upon communication with the teachers , it seemed none of them had any experience or a bachelors degree . this nursery is a disgrace to the british system , such a shame .
re : how good is rising star kindergarten ?
my kid goes to this kindergarten and she is happy there . sorry but it seems that your comments are too personal . you obviously had some personal bad intention by making this comments and anyone can see that .
re : how good is rising star kindergarten ?
i do n't really get where kiwi is getting her info from . i think it 's a ` disgrace ' and ` shameful ' that she is trying to incite hate when she is so clearly misinformed . i also do n't know why she is commenting on a post from a year ago . i smell sour grapes . anyways i 'm only commenting because i read her/his reply and i am appalled by why he/she is trying to slander such a lovely kindergarten . my son goes to rising stars and it has by far exceeded my expectations . everyone is friendly and polite , and the manager has always been professional in my presence . the children are definitely not left in the tv room all day , i have been at different times of the morning to pick up my son -LRB- we travel a lot -RRB- and he has always been in the classroom with his teacher . also to my knowledge they do follow the british curriculum for a kindergarten , and my son has flourished since attending . he cries when he is sick and ca n't go to school . as for your comment about ` british teachers ' , again as far as i know , they are n't all british but they are all english native speakers -LRB- apart from the arabic teacher and assistants -RRB- . i do n't really want to sound like an ad for rising stars or waste my time on a post that was made a year ago , so i would urge people to see for themselves what it is like , as my husband and i are extremely pleased with it .

you have to fill online application form which is quite long and requires alot of details . moreover , you have to book confirmed ticket copy and email confirmation -LRB- copy -RRB- of a hotel in advance or to provide them complete address where you will be living and with whom . they will ask for ur bank 's salary statement -LRB- 6 months -RRB- & salary letter from ur employer . original passport having atleast 3 or 6 months -LRB- not sure -RRB- validity from its expiry date . . its very easy to get visit visa if ur living in qatar for more than 1 year atleast will be beneficial for u and if ur born in qatar then 100 % success chance . anyhow , still see their site for fresh information on how to get visit visa of u.k. ??? . good luck and enjoy u.k. as i did alot with my wife

what is the best apartment building to live in at a reasonable price in doha ?
we are moving at the end of june . we are looking for an apartment that is nice in a good area that is reasonably priced . we would like to live near the water . does anyone have any ideas ?
re : what is the best apartment building to live in at a. . .
there are a lot of places that fit this description , with the exception of reasonable , of course . rents in doha are about 4 times what they are in the us and that is mostly because employers pay the bills . is your husband 's company not covering housing ? how about school tuition ? these are considered standard perks in doha . i would suggest coming to see first . you really do n't want to rent sight unseen here . there are too many nasty surprises .

re : visiting qatar on visit visa or business visa after ...
uarif , i was in this situation recently and i can assure you , from personal experiences , that without noc you can not enter the country on a visit or business visa . if your family is still in doha -LRB- father , mother , brother etc -RRB- you can enter on a family visit visa which is valid for one month extendable upto six months . that is the only option that you have . of course , if you are holding another gcc rp , then you can enter with an on-arrival visa -LRB- provided your profession falls in the eligible category -RRB- . make sure that the first time you fly to doha in this instance , you fly via the national carrier i.e. qatar airways . hope this was helpful .

why gold price increasing ?
gold price is steadily increasing . does it show the poor foundation of the fiat currency ?
re : why gold price increasing ?
because imf just sell a record quantity of gold to the central bank of india and look like china will follow suit . also because people are nervous about holding on to the us dollar due to the us inflation rate and the perceived slowness of recovery compared to the other economy . bad news for those receiving their income in us dollar or other currencies fixed-pegged to the greenback -LRB- such as qatari riyals -RRB-
re : why gold price increasing ?
its because the dollar is tumbling and festival and marriage season in india
re : why gold price increasing ?
it is the international trend ; recently india bought a significant quantity of gold and it seems to go on buying , from fmi ; so the price grows up . check the international market trend , now is around 1100 us $ / ounce , after the fmi sold cca 1/2 from it 's reserve of cca 400 tons gold . will increase in my opinion , too , because in crisis everybody invests in gold .
re : why gold price increasing ?
low dollar price pushes up the gold price as a hedge against possible future inflation .
re : why gold price increasing ?
due to high demand of gold in india & other country because of festival and safe money to invest .

is it true that jordanians now are being banned from qatar ?
is it true that jordanians now are being banned from qatar , i want to know because i am a jordanian and i signed a contract with governmental company in qatar since september 2008 -LRB- so since 5 months -RRB- and i contacted them several times and they keep saying : your visa still under procedure , i beginning to lose hope , so is it true that there is no visas now for jordanians ?
re : is it true that jordanians now are being banned ...
as long as i know , it is tru ! , i 'm also working in govt . sector -LRB- oil field -RRB- , and we are not getting jordanian visas , even for business visit -LRB- 14 days -RRB- , we are submitting for special approval .
re : is it true that jordanians now are being banned ...
unfortunately , this is what all say . . and even employees from egypt ... better to search in an other country ... good luck
re : is it true that jordanians now are being banned ...

re : is it true that jordanians now are being banned ...
correction : i do not think jordaninas are not allowed here , i witnessed very little number of cases being banned , keep your hope . a lot of jordanians obtained visas last two months so that should assure you
re : is it true that jordanians now are being banned ...
yes , absolutely correct ... i strongly advice you to find job somewhere else ... my experience recommend uae dubai . .
re : is it true that jordanians now are being banned ...
yes they can not get new resident visa for them in all companies
re : is it true that jordanians now are being banned ...
what is the root cause ?
re : is it true that jordanians now are being banned ...
any issue related to this is mainly because of political issue or non cooperation between qatar and the other country . in plus , they are banned because of the palestinians who have jordanian papers . there are too many here and the qatari goverment should make equilibrium between all nationalities ! i advice u not to ask for borrow visa or to shift ur visa . u ll be banned 100 % .
re : is it true that jordanians now are being banned ...
yes its true dat jordanians nationalities are now not getting visas , being in hr i also tried for their visa but no use , they can reniew the old residence but there is no chance for getting new visa . yallah bro best of luck , everything happens for good so dont loose hope allah mak . .
re : is it true that jordanians now are being banned ...
yes unfortunatly ... they reject my wife visa also since she is jordanian ... even i satisfied all the conditions from ministry and rent home and every thing . i called jordanian embassy and they told me the same .
re : is it true that jordanians now are being banned ...
i heard this ... jordonians and egyptians are inhold to enter qatar for employment .

kindly advise !
dear friends , i am 9 months pregnant . going to deliver my baby at womens hospital . my question is , what are the items i have to collect before admission in hospital . this is my second baby . first baby is c section . so kindly advise me for both c section and normal delivery . thanks in advance .
re : kindly advise !
ur first delivery was a c-section so da second one will also be da same ... ...
re : kindly advise !
as far as i know , you have to buy or arrange all your & your baby 's necessities yourself because the hospital provides only a disposable cap a dress . pampers & a feeder on request they may provide !
re : kindly advise !
in answer to your question - a baby is a baby no matter what method you deliver the baby . you will need : 1 -RRB- babygro for baby , 2 -RRB- hat 3 -RRB- scratch mitts 4 -RRB- clothes and toiletries for yourself - including a bit of makeup as this will make you feel better when your hormones are all over the place . 5 -RRB- light blanket for baby 6 -RRB- extra nappies and milk/bottles incase of emergency -LRB- hospital staff to busy to get your something asap -RRB- 7 -RRB- maternity pads and breast pads for yourself - with a few changes of underwear . 8 -RRB- as hospitals are boring ... maybe a book for yourself ? its better to be prepared with everything than not have anything when you really need it .

mobile and internet
hello everyone , how is the new vodafone mobile and broadband internet service in qatar and how is the coverage in all areas . this service appears easier on the pocket and more flexible and that 's why i am apprehensive about the service . or is qtel the best ? thanks . vivme
re : mobile and internet
hi , now a days healthy competetion is there in telecommunication sector , comparatively as a old company q-tel , s service is better than vodafone . but when u see as a new comer vodafone is performing better , q-tel coverage is better than vodafone all over qatar as well as internet . thank you ,
re : mobile and internet
vodafone is the best ...
re : mobile and internet
q-tel rocks love it , have been using their services for the past 9 years , they have realy improved over the years . q-tel coverage is all over qatar as well all over the world . my halla sim card worked in paris , uk , us and india .
re : mobile and internet
i read on ql a few months before , vodafone is agreed to use qtel data center that managed by qtel . so big possibility vodafone backbone still use qtel network . so better to use qtel directly .
re : mobile and internet
many thanks for all the answers .
walking in public with my dog
does anyone know if one is allowed to walk a dog in public ? i would love to take my dog for a walk on the corniche in the morning . i would of course leave him on the leash and not let him run loose . are dogs allowed in parks ?

those of you who have dogs , do you know of any place - preferably with a bit of greenery - that i can walk my dog ? the last place i tried was opposite khalifa stadium , i walked my dog there a few times but then last time a security guy showed up to tell me it was not allowed . where ever i took her for a walk i heard the same . i do n't like to keep her locked in the house . any suggestions ?
i 've seen many people
i 've seen many people walking their doggies at the corniche . so if you want to walk your dog do it when there are less people around preferably during the mornings . if you do get caught i 'm sure they will let u off with a warning so relax . why not just walk your dog around your living area ? or as suggested take your dog to some beach . . the nearest beaches are miles away though :p good fortune always comes knocking at your door ... when you are sh * tting in the toilet !! :-RRB- <p> _ -LSB- -RSB- ~ <strong> </strong> ~ -LSB- -RSB- _ </p> <p> < img src = `` http://www.skamu.com/icons/animated/images/icon41.gif ''

there is a lot of contradiction about walking your dog on the

i walk my dog everyday
i walk my dog everyday around the streets where i live . it is quite strange when people stop their cars and stare so i guess seeing a dog out for a walk is not very common . most parks have signs saying no dogs and i can understand this because not everyone looks after their dog correctly or cleans up after it .

i usually ride the bus every morning but i do n't take the bus with too many indians coz i ca n't really stand the smell of most of them , just like this morning , i told one guy to put his arm down coz i really felt dizzy due to the smell of his arm pit
but they certainly do make the best food
... stuff made with lots of cottage cheese , flour , sugar , spice and love ... yum ... man i miss those days ... ps ... the sikhs do not smell bad ... not the one 's i know ...

please be calm , guys !
you know guys i 'd appreciate the time you gave into discussion of my thread . but i see someone is hurt or someone is pointing another . as an author , i would like to apologize for posting this topic because i felt responsible for unpleasant responses from other people . its like somebody is throwing raze of fireball . please let us not do that . my main purpose of this is to gather views about proper hygiene to which helpful to the people involve who are unaware to have the foul-smelling odor in their bodies . i am very unfortunate that i do n't have a pc of my own so i ca n't check my threads every now and then . you know it happens that i have many co-workers coming from those countries -LRB- opps ... i 'm not pointing a particular nationality -RRB- that have a foul-smell . they are not just ordinary workers huh , they are supervisors ... that 's why i 'm so disgusted and i 'm trying to avoid them and even holding my breath when encountering them . i hope the mowasalat company would also encourage their drivers to be clean and defeinitely be free from the foul-smelling odor as they are serving the public because i 've observed that there drivers have a stink odor too ... guys , you can try this simple tip to lessen the foul-smelling odor of your colleage in the workplace : 1 . please advise him/her to use a very cheap deodorant like tawas or potassium alum . do it in a secret and gentle manner . a variuos kind of deodorant is available in the market . 2 . try to offer him/her a presents with a soap and deodorant inside . use your initiative to do it so that the person is not offended . above all , let us make peace , not war .

unless you go around shouting
unless you go around shouting `` we 're not married but living together '' the chances of anyone knowing are pretty remote .
chances = one unmarried couple

the chances depend entirely
the chances depend entirely on the accuracy and source of the information provided .

depends on how you go along
depends on how you go along with your neighbors and the people around you , aside from your partner .
so it all depends on the info

re : is there anybody living in the pearl ?
why not contact udc , if they are your developer , to get a clear picture -LRB- good or bad -RRB- , rather than rely on others , who may or may not be well-informed and could be giving you accurate information or idle speculation ? i am also an investor in the pearl , and have found , in all my dealings with udc -LRB- ie the people at the oyster -RRB- , that they are very professional , helpful and transparent . they will tell you the situation as it stands now , progress and delays , because it is in their interests to ensure that investors have confidence in them and their project . my apartment is in viva bahriya , so not due for completion yet . it is hard to wait , because once you 've been down and seen for yourself the scope of the project , you just want to move in and enjoy sitting on your balcony overlooking the sea . ignore the snipers , stay cool , it will be worth the wait !

i know it is hard to wait , especially given the current economic uncertainty , but none of us -LRB- including the developer and the banks -RRB- could have predicted what has happened , on a global scale , over the last few months , so we are all having to adjust to the new reality which we didnt foresee when we originally made the investment . as any investment is about confidence , it does n't make sense to ` talk down ' the project , or encourage rumours about how awful the project is . if you look at other threads on this subject , you can see that those directly involved in the construction are all proud of it : only those unconnected but with ` inside knowledge ' -LRB- ie from friends of friends -RRB- are predicting doom . again , i suggest that you go down to the site and speak to the developer to get a clearer picture which will help you plan .
re : is there anybody living in the pearl ?
no one lives at the pearl yet . as there is no water or electricity services yet . udc and kharamma are locked in a power struggle over costs and the poor buyers of flats are the losers .
re : is there anybody living in the pearl ?
having followed up with udc , i have learned that the issue with the power supply was in fact resolved almost 2 weeks ago and they expect people to be living in porto arabia by the end of may . please do n't take my word for this , -LRB- after all i could just be another one spreading rumors -RRB- , check with them yourself to see how your property fits into the schedule . hope it goes well for you !
re : is there anybody living in the pearl ?
i talked to udc and they said their towers will be opened in may . electricity and water problems are solved and ready for all porto arabia . i guess in the 4th quarter of this year , most of the towers will be opened . i was in abu dhabi at the weekend and stayed in one of my friends apartment . his apartment is having a magnificent sea view next to beach -LRB- like the apartment in the pearl -RRB- . it gives me some idea how the life will be in the pearl ; simply `` dolce vita !!! '' . most of the people living in doha can not imagine the life style in the pearl and when it will be completed , i am sure it will be one of the dream place to live in . so , we waited a lot but i guess it will worth it !
re : is there anybody living in the pearl ?
istavrit , i was down there this week as well and totally amazed at the progress , especially with the shops -LRB- ok , just need the money to buy -RRB- , cafes and landscaping . the waterfront is beautiful and the atmosphere unlike anywhere else in doha , more reminiscent of palm beach or parts of europe . the project is really moving on and taking shape .

american expat area
are there certain areas in doha that are most popular with american expats ? are there certain areas to avoid ?
re : american expat area
thanks for the replies . i too am an american engineer , and look forward to experiencing living in a different part of the wold . my company is providing housing , and i was looking for insight from an independent source . thanks again .
re : american expat area
i have been wondering this also ... i see lots of british and canadian folks ... i know there has to be some americans here ... must be an underground thing .
re : american expat area
all of doha is safe . everyone here is mixed nationalities . it 's much more fun that way ! what 's the point of going abroad if you do n't want to meet other cultures ? i am american , working for an american company , but on my company compound my neighbors are from all over the world . most companies place their employees in housing -LRB- easiest and cheapest way to go . -RRB- only place to avoid is the industrial area , but since you are lucky enough not to be a 3rd world laborer , you have no worries there . enjoy doha

the difference can be sachin tendulkar ... compared to vinod kambli . sachin had a steady girlfriend very early in life i guess from age 13 onwards whom he later on married . this would go on to be instrumental and had his feet on firm ground when he found name and fame . comparatively vinod kambli went crazy after getting fame and women ... he even had an early divorce . at that point in time vinod kambli was knocking up double centuries when sachin was struggling to score centuries ... today its a completely differently story . consistent sachin is head and shoulders above all cricketers the world has ever known ...

re : how to open a kindergarden school on private basis ?
i assume you are planning to set up kindergarden school -LRB- nursery -RRB- at your villa right ? 1 -RRB- first of all , i do not think you can open something commercial business while you are residing in the same villa -LRB- you got to acquire new villa/building which should be vacant -RRB- 2 -RRB- of course for any business in qatar , you need a qatari sponsor -LRB- even wll or qatari proprietorship -RRB- 3 -RRB- then usual documentation like chamber of commerce -LRB- for name registration -RRB- , commercial registration , rental agreement , municipality inspection/approval , computer card , labour ministry registration etc. if wll , you may have to go to ministry of economics & commerce for the registration of articles of association -LRB- partnership deed -RRB- . the documentation either you can do it on your own going step by step or can hire the services -LRB- pro -RRB- against payment . hope you must have got some idea , all the best .

money for the first month in doha
i am joining a major company in doha soon and would like to know how much money is enough to cover the basics till i receive my first salary , excluding accommodation . this is providing that they pay the salary at the end of the month do they ? thank you , ls
re : money for the first month in doha
if the accomodation n the transportation is provided , just bring 2k qatari riyal would be more than enough ~ but still it depends on how u eat , if everyday you re talkin bout hotel dining , then please bring more
re : money for the first month in doha
5000qr
re : money for the first month in doha
10,000 qr is enough for u.
re : money for the first month in doha
yeah i think 10000 will do
re : money for the first month in doha
u can keep abt 500-1000 . but u can ask ur company for advance payment of your salary ...
re : money for the first month in doha
well it depends on several things , are you staying in a hotel or you have the accommodation provided by the company , rent for one bedroom -LRB- studio -RRB- is around 4,000 / month two bedrooms for 6,500 / month or more if fully furnished or not . furnishing an appartment will take around 4,000 and more , food & beverage around 2,000 - 3,000 . and then u have transportation if you will use a bus one way ticket is 3 qr the cab minimum around 18/trip depends on the distance but it is extreemle hard to find a cab sometimes so you will have regular people stop to pick u up -LRB- for money off course , around 30 qrs minimum , u can book a cab on the phone :-RRB- , so you will need around gbp 2,700 ... hope this helps
re : money for the first month in doha
2000 qr for car mounthly 6000 qr house rent monthly 3000 qr food for one persone monthly 1000 qr telephone monthly 2000 qr for trafic penalty monthly
re : money for the first month in doha
if accommodation & transportation is taken care of by your employer then 2000-3500 is enough .

i am now in visiting visa sponsered by my husband and visa expires on april . could you please let me know when can he apply for the next visit visa and when can i be back to qatar , at the earliest ?
re : duration between 2 visit visas
i heard minimum three months gap between exit & re entry . btw how many months visa ur having now ? 3month or 6 months .
re : duration between 2 visit visas
you need to have minimum 3 months gap to apply again ... <!--break-->
re : duration between 2 visit visas
if you could more elaborate that would be easy for us to tell you ... if you got an extension off 5 months in total 6 , you will have to exit and your husband can apply again after 3 months , but mostly after 2 months immigration approves the application for family visit visa ...

re : i am a filipino expat , i want to ask what are the ...
same question
re : i am a filipino expat , i want to ask what are the ...
here are some things that might help . firstly , the bare minimum stuff . 1 -RRB- salary of 7000 or higher -LRB- sometimes they approve for 6000 also -RRB- . 2 -RRB- six months bank statement with salary transfer . 3 -RRB- you need to be an rp holder . 4 -RRB- your designation on visa shld be respectable . something like engineer or doctor or manager or accountant etc. believe me point 4 is the most important . i have a friend who earns 15k per month , but due to lack of visas his company had given him a field operator visa for temp purposes , and now he is not able to sponser his wife . now that you got the basics straight ... you need a few documents . 1 -RRB- go to some arabic typing guys near sofitel -LRB- there are lots of them there -RRB- . 2 -RRB- they have a sample of no objection certificate . get it typed in arabic with your details . 3 -RRB- get the offer letter -LRB- they have sample -RRB- also typed from them . 4 -RRB- get 3 copies of 2 & 3 and get them signed and sealed from ur sponsor . 5 -RRB- take those docs to the labour department and submit them . they will keep 1 copy and return you 2 more . keep 1 for yourself and give 1 to your employer / sponsor . if you already have a 6 month bank statement , then you can readily apply for an rp . if not , you can get your wife here on a visit visa and later convert it to rp . to apply for or visit visa , get the visa form filled -LRB- from same sofitel place -RRB- and take it to any visa centre -LRB- meisaimer center is good as it has good number of counters -RRB- . all the best .

vitamin d
dear all , anyone can educate me about vitamin d. i am found deficient and even after a month of medication havent had a good result . but i have also noticed that it seems to be a regional profile , a lot of other women i know have a deficient profile . thanks
thanks
thanks drsam . do you know if deificiency can cause low mood , anxiety etc
the link between vitamin d
the link between vitamin d deficeincy and depression -LRB- bipolar disorder , low-mood ... -RRB- exists . scientific studies place hypovitd as a risk factor , not a triggering causal factor of depression . tablef-6 evidence map for neuropsychological functioning page 1022 http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=13050&page=1022
polly , i 'm sure the doctor
polly , i 'm sure the doctor might have suggested you weekly tablets and injection for vitamin d 's deficiency . you should add some nutritious food in your diet , take full cream milk , mixed fruit salad , vegetables especially beet root ... it will improve your condition isa .
vitamin d is used by the body
vitamin d is used by the body to process calcium for the bones . it 's naturally occurring when you 're in the sunlight . i strongly suggest that you take a walk after you eat right before sunset . make sure that you eat calcium containing products -LRB- milk , cheese -RRB- as well as items from all the food groups -LRB- vegetables , meat , dairy -RRB- . if you are lactose intolerant , try taking calcium supplements . it 's best if u allow your body to produce vitamin d naturally instead of taking medication .
hi pollyj
this is very common in doha now a days , causes yet to know.but frankly speaking you did not mention here how much the value you have at present by the blood test revealed.as i do practice here first re-place the insuficiency by injections why ? ofcourse the potiency of the drug will rapidly get to the noraml target i.e. 30-8o . your doctor will investigate why you have this deficiency could be any reason for that . exposer to sun will just normally help every one but sudden low should be properly investigate.till then cheers !!
hi shinewood , i am at a
hi shinewood , i am at a score of around 10 and this after a medication of 1.5 months . can vit d deficiency cause depression like symptoms ? my doctors feel i may have an absorption issue . thanks all for responding
pollyj
this is what i would like to say earlier may be you have an issue of absorption problem.not only depression may take you many other problems
this is bizzare ! the sunlight
this is bizzare ! the sunlight triggers vitamin d production . is n't there enough sun here ? of course , if you cover up , you 'll have to suffer .
if the uv index is 2 , 30 min
if the uv index is 2 , 30 min in the sun exposing as much of ur skin , twice aweek at noon . uv2 in doha : from november to february . uv = 3 10 min 2 times a week at noon . uv3 in doha : sept , oct , march , april at noon summer before 11:00 and after 15:00
drsam ... thats great info .
drsam ... thats great info . noted .
however all official studies
however all official studies ca n't recommend sunlight exposure for vit d since toomany risks -LRB- dna deterioration , cancer skin , sun stroke , eye problems ... -RRB- and to many parameters -LRB- skin color , location , time , uv index , ... -RRB- these official studies stress on the intake or vit d. for the ultime reference -LRB- a 1100 + pages -RRB- that sum up all researches , and all previous studies : http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=13050 not for faint hearted tho ! have a look .
it mainly affects local woman
it mainly affects local woman as they cover up too much . vit d is produced natuarally by your body on exposure to sun light . only in extreme cases should you need supplements .
bahrain f1
hi guys ! anyone planning to watch the bahrain f1 ? im contemplating on a road trip to bahrain ... i just dont know if its a good idea . need your thoughts on this one .
road trip sounds nice ...
mr shyams im planning to go by land to bahrain as well . maybe you can give me some tips after you 've completed the drive . be safe !
sure wapo888
i will post here after my trip . i am traveling with garmin assistance . so can even share the route if you have a gps .
just follow the coast
just follow the coast ;-RRB- are n't visas going to be more the problem when you go through saudi ? as balders mentioned , uni stand good , i was there last year . reasonable ticket and you see more of the track , start , first bend , and also some of the middle of the track .
thats the nightmare
saudi visa is the nightmare . i doubt on it being umra time ... lets see . for fellas planning to take road to bahrain for f1 , better act now and apply for saudi visa . saudi embassy might close for the umra . i was suppose to go last week but due to visa delay postponed to this week ... . bahrain visa -LRB- if needed -RRB- could be obtained online with evisa service or at causeway . for evisa , apply a week prior , this will save the hassle at causeway . best wishes .
can you hire a boat/yacht
can you hire a boat/yacht and sail to bahrain ?
nope unfortunately ...
if that being the case qatar airways would be at loss ... :--RRB- . and this is the most profitable route for qatar airways . thats the reason the friendship bridge between doha and bahrain delayed , as per sources . .

what are you really up to ? -LRB- gunpowder is a mixture of sulfur , charcoal , and potassium nitrate -RRB- .
re : where can i buy saltpetre / potassium nitrate ?
ha i am really up to amateur charcuterie , not bomb making ! i used to buy it in the uk although it is difficult to get hold of for exactly the reason you mention ... i used to make air dried hams , bacons etc , and saltpetre kills botulsim and keeps the meat a nice pink colour . i am wanting to make kadid which is arabic air dried mutton , to make a tasty couscous ! there must be some kind of chemical supply co. here ...
re : where can i buy saltpetre / potassium nitrate ?
you will need a special permit to bring any dual use chemical into the country , including : 1 . civil defense + environmental commission + municipality approved storage facility 2 . importation of hazardous substances must be specifically mentioned on company cr . you can not import hazardous substances in your personal capacity . 3 . in addition to the above , you will need to submit hazmat data sheet along with import documents to customs with civil defense and environmental approval with each and every consignment . 4 . if material is classified as explosive or highly flammable , you will also need to have the documents approved by ministry of interior -LRB- police -RRB- . this applies to anything from paint thinner to you name .
re : where can i buy saltpetre / potassium nitrate ?
wow thanks ... but i do n't want to import it - i just want to buy a couple of hundred grammes . you mention that you would need to complete that process to import e.g. paint thinner - however paint thinner is available for retail purchase in stores here , so presumably the restriction is on retailers , not retail buyers ... there must be a shop out there somewhere !!
re : where can i buy saltpetre / potassium nitrate ?
why not you use salt as a substitute afterall we know that these nitrates are now linked to so many types of cancers ?

with this much traffic in doha waiting in the r/b or step by step in alnasr street in the thursday evening the automatic is the best but the most strong gearbox is the manual ones any way drive safe :-RRB- <a title="everything you need to know about living in doha, qatar" href="http://www.qatarliving.com"> <img src="http://static.qatarliving.com/badges/150x50_iloveqatarliving.gif" alt="everything you need to know about living in doha, qatar" /> </a>
automatic ... anywhere anytime ...
automatic ... anywhere anytime ... why to keep changing gears ? 1 . in automatic the chances of error during change of gear speed especially at roundabouts is zero . 2 . also with automatic one can use both hands to control the vehicle at r/abouts and dont have to keep shifting gears thereby giving improved control . the above 2 add to give one the split second advantage when other driver makes some error and you can either slow down abruptly or give way swiftly . and of course one can slow down to a halt and then accelerate in an instant without going from 4th gear to 1st and then 2nd and 3rd & finally 4th . the only advantage manual has is the pickup one can get from 1st gear and the driver decides when to switch to a higher gear and this is usually done faster manually .
manual of course , u can
manual of course , u can control the car more . plus , sports cars are manual . .
hey foolish ...
<b> if you are about buy a new car i suggest manual . or else automatic . u might have to face many issues with gearbox/cluth alone if the vehicle is old . in the current situation in doha , many people will opt . for automatic transmission , but even its a sporty or non sporty vehicle , i love manual transmission . think about manul if you are buying a new one . </b> `` never love a person you can live with , always love a person you can never live without ''
manual anyday
as i said above ... way more sexy ... but sadly it seems less than 25 % of cars sold are manual these days ... at this rate they soon be extinct ... like the dinos ... ; -LRB-
for doha
get automatic , but if you love speed and sporty get manual . .

a/t vs m/t
a/t vs m/t : automatic gives you more control over the steering wheel -LRB- when you are in the middle lane of a 3 lane r/a -RRB- as you can use both hands . with automatic also you can save fuel by going into neutral on straight stretches . you can also go into 1st gear , 2nd gear & 3rd gear !!! -LRB- this is very useful while going uphill on a long mountainous terrain -RRB- . <b/> thus you can use automatic as a manual car but not viceversa </b> and is there a cruise control for manual cars ? it has the most fuel savings advantage on long routes .

well i think if you want cheap ac filling then its in al aziziya ... behind the aziziya compound ... he charges 150 ... and hes good in his work
re : hi , can any one tell me where can we fill the car a/c ...
you only need to fill the car aircon if it 's not working . the gas should not leak out in normal use , or disappear , or shrink . if your aircon has stopped working duev to a gas leak , you can re-fill it which may last a few weeks or so - but repairs are needed if your gas is gone . should be about qr150 to fill - but it will quickly become cheaper to fix the leak .

contrary to popular belief , doha does n't want any tourists . ever . if you want to visit the gulf and have a nice time , try visiting , umm , any place but doha . hotels are too expensive , there is nothing for tourists to do , and the authorities have created rules to ensure that tourists do n't have fun . basically - tourists are n't wanted here . go someplace else .

re : laptop deals
sofitel and jarir are fine ... you will find a good deal in one of these places .
re : laptop deals
try villagio carrefour or jarir bookshop .

suggestion talk to your employer ... ...
talk to your employer tell him you have to give him one or two months salary in exhanged for noc . most employer agreed in that kind of agreement . otherwise no choice u hv to pack all your things and wait for two years . option 2 : if you are hired any of qatar government offices or qp , rasgas . no need of noc letter . they will write a letter to that company asking an noc for you ... unless you donot have any bad records from your previous employer ...

can films help change society ?
read an interesting article about the power of film . the premise is that movies can send a message to the audience and thus help change society . an example given was `` the blind side '' . i saw this film , loved it , but did it help me become a better person ? i do n't know . . recently , someone stated `` people get their values from the silver screen . '' would you agree ?

since long time americans are getting inspiration from their hollywood , look at rambo type movies , perhaps they need another episode to capture osama and taliban 's leader .
yes
i do think films have an effect on some a lotta people in society . i did like `` the blind side '' , it is a beautiful film and i remember reading an article later about a few people being taken in by that movie and legally adopting afro-american kids like him . nomerci is right about the action flicks and well as the chick-flicks . rags to riches movies also do have an effect on the less fortunate who strive hard to complete their education and work harder to get noticed .

of course the mass
of course the mass media/movie production can change society . but i would n't use word `` help '' . `` help '' is something positive , while mass production can affect society very negatively . movie can definitely form a certain images , pattern behavior , stereotypes , etc. all film companies reduce the number of smoking scenes in their films , some of them have banned these scenes completely . movie creates stereotypes that are followed by people . girls want to look , to be dressed and to behave as their favorite actress . guys want to act like their hero acts . this is normal process . brit , one separate movie might not help one individual become better -LRB- but also might help -RRB- , but creating a whole image of certain behavior and stereotypes in the society definitely can make this society better -LRB- or worse -RRB-

re : puppy
do you have a plan in place to take the puppy home ? please make sure you do . my self i have found my 2 amazing dogs from qaws but i always intend to take them home.i see so many people rescue animals and then leave them behind which is not fair on the animal . a dog can live as long as 18 years and you have to answer the question . can i commit that long to them ? if you can then go for it as dogs give you so much love : -RRB-
re : puppy
i would say qaws too . we adopted one around 3 weeks ago from there , it was the day after the big fire and we have a great dog . best not go to a pet shop as i have heard that they do not look after the animals at all .
re : puppy
defo qaws . the fire has left so many dogs homeless and without the kindness of all the people who have fostered them they would be on the streets .
re : puppy
as all said , contact qaws . much better to adopt dog or puppy from there than buy from a pet shop . then afterwards when you plan to leave qatar commit yourself to also take your dog with you , and not leave it behind , struggling to survive and hungry .

hello , please do the following steps : 1 -RRB- remove the battery , check the ac adapter pin . plug only ac adapter to the laptop and check if laptop powers on only on ac-adapter . 2 -RRB- if laptop powers on using only ac adapter-shut down the system , plug in the battery . go-to the bios by using f2 key while the system startup and check if the adapter is listed in the bios -LRB- it will be listed as 60w/90w or according to the model of the adapter -RRB- . 3 -RRB- if the adapter is not listed in the bios , you can try updating the bios by downloading the latest bios updates from www.support.dell.com . while updating the bios ensure that both battery and ac adapter are plugged-in . 4 -RRB- if the problem persists , please replace the ac adapter . as it is 8 months old , it is under warranty . best of luck !
re : dell laptop charger plugged in but not charging - pls ...
i had same problem with my hp notebook and after a few trips to the service center the problem persisted , they said its a software problem with vista . after a lot of googling this is what worked for me : 1 . click start and type device in the search field , then select device manager . 2 . expand the batteries category . 3 . under the batteries category , right-click the microsoft acpi compliant control method battery listing , and select uninstall . warning : do not remove the microsoft ac adapter driver or any other acpi compliant driver . 4 . on the device manager taskbar , click scan for hardware changes . alternately , select action > scan for hardware changes . windows will scan your computer for hardware that does n't have drivers installed , and will install the drivers needed to manage your battery 's power . the notebook should now indicate that the battery is charging .

basic islam
is there such a place here in doha where the newly converts go just learn the basic of islam like how to perform pray and other basic things that every muslim should know ? when i checked with al fanar back in july 2012 , they do n't any class for newly converts . thank you .

i seriously doubt about srk
i seriously doubt about srk and salman 's religions ! just getting a birth in a muslim family does not make a person muslim , otherwise the son of prophet nuh -LRB- peace be on him -RRB- would be a muslim . everybody needs to strive for knowledge of islam and implement the rules and discipline in their personal life .
vic
maybe bro maybe ... but how will knowing whether or not these stars are muslims , benefit us ? in fact , may allah protect us , by wasting time trying to find out about their place in islam , we can commit bigger sins and even lose our islam , due to our lack of knowledge on things that are far more pressing . but yes you are right , being born to a muslim family does not make one a muslim , and i know this firsthand , sadly , due to the state of my own family and who i was less than ten years back , astaghfirullah !

buddy i say let 's all keep our houses in order and the rest will automatically fall in place . besides , it is not any person 's place to judge others and their standing in allah 's sight . we do not know how allah judges us . it is possible salman khan is more dear to god than you or me because of some small good deed he did sometime . if a 100 time murderer and a prostitute were forgiven and granted heaven for merely watering a thirsty dog , salman stands a good chance too allah willing . so yeah let 's all pray for each other and keep our own islam strong : - -RRB-
fathimah
you stated you were ' a certain way ten years back ' . i get your intention and am sure you do n't plan to anyway but please do not mention any more details of why or how you were a bad or lost muslim . the reason i say that is because people frequently curiously ask for more details . . and we in good faith spill all our beans . . but allah frequently veils for us our sins from the world and people because he intends to forgive those sins . i too have been and still am a somewhat lost muslim but alhamdulillah god has shielded all those sins from people and inshallah it will only be between me and him . thus we should not openly declare what allah has mercifully hidden for us . and i hope we are not hijacking the thread . . well we are but not really lol
moh yes you are right
guess my intention of saying so was to specify more why i do n't judge people due to y' know . . but you are absolutely right , jazakhallah khair for your advice . as always we are all in need of one another for advice and help . may allah truly forgive us all , increase us in knowledge and grant us success in this world and the next . . aameen and yes that was a hijack , but hopefully it will be viewed as a `` good '' one !

hi zuperzue !!
my names craig , md of mirage properties here in qatar . regards your queries i can pretty much second what most others have said so far . if you 're a single person working in west bay area then you 're better off finding an apartment in a good quality building near to work . villa compounds here are usually geared towards family living as most are 4-5 bed + properties . however , saying that we have just released an apt compound , on al waab st , which would give the best of both worlds . sadly for you , these have all been leased i 'm afraid . if you do opt for a pearl apt , or one of the better towers in the business district , you will usually get all the facilities you would find on a compound and be living with like minded people . when searching for property please be aware that there are 3 types of furnished basis here in qatar : unfurnished -LRB- u/f -RRB- - means you get nothing , not even kitchen appliances and sometimes no ac either , in very extreme cases and usually in older properties you do n't even get kitchen cabinets . semi furnished -LRB- s/f -RRB- - kitchen appliances , a/c 's and sometimes curtains . fully furnished -LRB- f/f -RRB- - kitchen appliances , furniture , curtains , tv , dvd and sometimes bedding , kitchen utensils , crockery , cutlery etc -LRB- but not usual -RRB- . price difference between s/f & f/f is usually around qr1 ,500 - qr3 ,000 extra per month . if you 'd like to get an idea of what 's available in the market at the moment , please take a look on our site www.mirageproperty.com , which lists a whole range of properties , both exclusive to ourselves and from the open market . if you see anything you like and want more info , please feel free to contact us through the site and one of my agents will be in contact . i hope we can be of help . kind regards craig at mirage

yesterday night around 12:30 am i got radar through mobile radar while moving from muntaza signals to gulf cinema signal . my car speed was over 140 km/h where the speed limit is only 80 km/h on the same road . how much i have to pay the fine ?????????? also is the fine value depends on the car speed ??????????????????
re : mobile radar fine . . ?
omg 140 km/h in a 80 km/h zone . working in a ministry and not respecting the laws ?? how come ?? dude what was wrong with you ?? c'mon do n't you want to live ?? my guess is you will have a skyhigh penalty . wait for metrash system to be updated and check it online regards !!
re : mobile radar fine . . ?
traffic law fines/points system action : 7.-driving a vehicle on the road recklessly or carelessly or in a way that endangers life of people and properties . penalty imprisonment of minimum one month and maximum 3 years and / or fine of minimum 10000 riyals and maximum 50000 riyals according to article no -LRB- 94 -RRB- . the punishment will be double by the minimum level in case of repeating the same violation according to article number -LRB- 98 -RRB- . some more detail action 38 . - exceeding posted speed limit on the road . penalty qr .500 ; and to be increased by qr .100 for every 10 km / hour of speed to the maximum penalty of qr .1000 .
re : mobile radar fine . . ?
you will have to wait a couple days for it to come up so you can check on moi.gov.qa , my guess is it is going to be a very high fine as you went very very over the speed limit . need to drive safe .
re : mobile radar fine . . ?
oooooooooo god , thnx for your responces . me also waiting sms from matresh .
re : mobile radar fine . . ?
rms since it is a mobile radar no need to flash ... it will record anyway . people be safe please !!
re : mobile radar fine . . ?
yes its like a black colored small robot connected with car type battery . now i went out and pass by the same road , they already removed the radar from their , according to one source these kinds of radars are works in night time only ... thnx elioswd have a great and save weekend , all of you .
re : mobile radar fine . . ?

re : mobile radar fine . . ?

buying a car outside of qatar
i 'm looking to by a new car , but the local gm dealer is useless and looked at me like i 'd asked for a turbocharged donkey when i said i wanted a manual gearbox . so , i 've seen the car i want in dubai . is it possible for me to get a loan here , buy the car from dubai , import and then register it here , or will the bank not allow it as the car is n't in country ? thanks
intrest rates
hi alan , you might wan na re look at the difference in intrest rates between a car loan approx 3.4 % as compared to approx 9 % for a personal loan . if you check with manager -LRB- not sales guy -RRB- of gmc they can get the car down from dxb for you . i hear the drive down is no fun either and not too safe too . just curious why would you like to drive a manual car when you can go in for a triptronic instead . with the increase in traffic an auto is de way to go -LRB- just my oponion -RRB-
madilulur , ignore the
mandilulur , ignore the profile , its nonsense . i refuse to post anything remotely truthful about myself on a public forum . my name is n't alan either , but it 'll do for this forum :-RRB- b2d , driving is always fun , i love cars , always have . plus its an adventure , never done it before :-RRB- cy , i know about the rates , but the actual monthly payment costs are n't too different , yes i pay more overall , but i can accept that for the convenience it gives me in choosing the car i want . i 'm a brit , i grew up driving manuals and its a more compelling experience than having an automatic decide when to change gear . i bought the car , i 'll decide when to change . personal opinion on triptronics is they are there for show , and they still are n't as good as a manual box . the wannabe schumacher 's of this world can have them , i 'll stick with a standard 6 speed box thanks . easier to hang the arse out of a rwd v8 when you can control the gearbox , not a sodding computer . : -RRB-
xena , i picked that name
xena , i picked that name because i used to wear glasses that reminded my work colleagues of him :-RRB- i think asking for a manual here is as shocking as asking for a bacon sandwich .
maybe you could get the
maybe you could get the personal loan get the car and then switch to a car loan -LRB- for the lower rate ? -RRB- worth asking about - worst they can do is say no and you 're just back to where you are now
auto over manual
ok got one last one in me , been here for 9 years now and have owned 4 cars here just bought my 5th - gmc denali its an triptronic loads of fun to drive around . as you all have mentioned the reaction that you get when u ask the sales guy for a manual , it is that much more difficult to sell a secound hand manual . its much much easier -LRB- and gets you a better resale price -RRB- to sell an automatic if when you deside to sell for what ever reason .
cy , fair point , well made : -RRB-
cy , fair point , well made :-RRB- but i still want a manual . more expats than locals in this country , so i do n't think it will be a massive problem come sale time .
lol , totally see where you
lol , totally see where you are coming from . but , the clincher for me is this ... ... . auto 's are crap at losail : -RRB-
instead of a car loan
take a personal loan for the amount needed for the car ... you can then have the money paid to your account and you can do with it what you like : - -RRB-
xena , now that 's what i
xena , now that 's what i wanted clarification on . i know i ca n't take a car loan as it would be secured against the car , which is difficult when i have to go out of country for it . sooooooo , it is possible to take a personal loan and get the car . might have to investigate this a bit further :-RRB- saeedkan , you 'll have to show me this trick of eating the wrong way . i thought there was only one way : -RRB-
alancarr
at one stage i wanted to by a second hand car and the bank suggested that due to the interest rate being so high for second hand , about 12 % , why not take a personal loan at 8/9 % and pay for the car that way :--RRB- so yes , it can be done .
rye to be honest , i would do
rye to be honest , i would do something similar , but my parents live in dubai , so i 'll just book it in for a service over there and go visit for the weekend . drive down will be fun too . xena , thanks for the info , all good to know .

rimlaw ... so what is the safest way of transaction ?
rimlaw ... so what is the safest way of transaction ? since cheques & promissory notes are not enforceable .
cheques and promissory notes
cheques and promissory notes are admissible in evidence for civil cases such as collection cases for sum of money , judicial foreclosure of mortgage , etc. but not for ciminal prosecution of estafa or deceit . while checks may have probative value to establish motive or intent it is not the quantum of proof to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt . promissory notes on the other hand will disprove estafa since this document will clearly establish a loan transaction . the safest way in transaction involving forebearance of money or exchange of goods for money is to have a contract or document that clearly specify the nature of transaction . never get swayed by sweet talking persons and you might end up scammed .
ministry of human rights
ministry of human rights somewhere in westbay
intelligent ...
what is estafa ?
if estafa is what mj said ,
if estafa is what mj said , then what human rights can do with that ? honestly , i think nobody can do anything about it , unless there is a legal written contract of lending/borrowing money . even in this case the procedure is way too long and you might end up with giving to the lawyers much more money than you are owed ... <i> <b> ********************* you become responsible forever for what you have tamed . antoine de saint-exupry </b> </i> <img src="http://cdnll.img1.imagechef.com/w/080610/anmd46ebbf9c8c024ef.gif">
you have 3 options . you may
you have 3 options . you may lodged a complaint or blotter with any nearest police station . if he is a foreigner , the police will give him a visit together with your complaint . if the respondent will not own up , they can file your complaint with the prosecutors . if the respondent is qatari , you go to the ministry of human rights and they will assist you there . you may also try your embassy which normally have legal officers familiar with local criminal procedures to assist you . good luck .
qatar criminal and civil
qatar criminal and civil procedures are unique in the entire gulf region . it has both the regular courts and the sharia courts . for estafa or deceit , it is normally filed with a complaint with the prosecutor and after preliminary investigation , it will be filed with the court of first instance . you need not hire a lawyer since the prosecutor will be your lawyer . but bear in mind to produce evidence on estafa or deceit . if you have no documentary exhibits forget your complaint and charge it to experience . sharia courts handle family relations law and criminal cases involving qataris and muslim litigants . cases involving foreigners , civil or criminal are handled by regular courts .
evidence is very important
evidence is very important in criminal prosecution . oral testimony will not prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt , the quantum of evidence required to convict an accused in a criminal prosecution . the rejoinder of qatarisun is well taken , your respondent can easily deny having received money from you or simply say that the money is simple loan , and you have no case for estafa . the essential element of estafa is `` trust '' and `` exchange of goods or money '' . prove this both and you have a case for estafa .
the formality or informality
the formality or informality of your document is immaterial . what is material for your case to prosper in ourt is the substance of your document . it must show the nature of your transaction , mentions the goods or money he received , his name and signature thereon , and any witnesses to the transaction . if you parted goods or money based on his representations , and which you awfully trusted , and his promise or acknowledgement of paying you back , and he reneged on this promise , then you have a criminal case for deceit or estafa .
there you have it , your
there you have it , your reference to the word `` borrowed '' presuppose the existence of a simple loan , and your allegations for estafa is doomed . electronic mails or emails are now admissible in evidence in courts under certain qualifications . but what you have on hand is evidence of simple loan not estafa . in which case , if the amount involved is substantial , you are advised to seek a local lawyer to assist you in filing a simple case for sum of money and damages . legal fees here are quite expensive , prepare with your deep wallet .
ms j , promissory notes are
ms j , promissory notes are not evidence of estafa but of loan . promissory notes are ancillary documents to the principal contracts of loan . if one can not pay his loan , you do not sue him for estafa even if this is accompanied promissory notes and with rubber checks . issuance of bounching checks are not punishable as a crime in qatar if that is what you have in mind .

re : where to have your car mud-painted ?
do n't wash your car . after one week it looks like you want it , and it does n't cost anything .
re : where to have your car mud-painted ?
i think you can have it done at any car accessories shop .
re : where to have your car mud-painted ?
you can do it yourself with dishwashing liquid .

* fishing * where can i get bait here in doha ... specifically worms ??
i just moved here from the usa and was wondering if there is anywhere to get worms ? i know we are in the desert and this may not be possible , but , ca n't hurt to ask . ps what do people use out here mostly ... sardines ?
re : * fishing * where can i get bait here in doha ...
thank you so much for the feedback !! i appreciate it : -RRB-
re : * fishing * where can i get bait here in doha ...
well , usually the ideal way to use or hook up are the worms , but u jus cant find them in here , we use hardened wheat flour , sardines also , a fake small fish , with smell . u can buy them at the shops . i havent tried it yet , see your luck , and let us know wat u have caught ! i miss fishing at new york , hudson river , ontario lake !
re : * fishing * where can i get bait here in doha ...
i think u can find in shops where selling fishing rod , hook etc. . because last time when i was byuing a fishing rod i saw there in bottles and i asked the shopkeeper and he told me this is worms using for fishing . the shops are located in somewhere in souq in between islamic meusium roundabout and clock roundabout . somewher same line with galaxy sports.ther are 2 or 3 shops ... io think
re : * fishing * where can i get bait here in doha ...
sparkle , it depends what and where you want to fish , i guess for sherry kalamari or squid works well , for baracuda sardine or mackarel , you can even try a lure , rapala sxr 14 is good for beach casting , for safi you can try wheat flour mix , shrimps is effective but doesnt work if you want to cast some distance , hope it helps and yes for most of the baits you should buy either from fish market or lulu . tight lines .
re : * fishing * where can i get bait here in doha ...
i dont think there are places where u can get worms/baits/lures here ... for baits and lures , i guess its best to order online . . you can check out a whole list of options in the link below : http://www.fishinfo.com/resources/lures.htm

is anyone using an electronic book reader -LRB- ex . kindle -RRB- in doha ?
i am thinking to get an electronic book reader for my daughter and need to know if it will work in doha and which brand is mac compatible ... anybody have any experience with them ?
re : is anyone using an electronic book reader -LRB- ex . kindle ...
both the wife and i use kindles here in doha . the wireless obviously does not work , but you can download books to the pc easily and put them on the kindle . books are way cheaper this way and a much better selection than any store in doha . i have no idea about mac compatibility . i suggest you check out amazon.com and find out .
re : is anyone using an electronic book reader -LRB- ex . kindle ...
ditto what the first poster said . i have the kindle , friends have the sony reader , and both work fine here in doha . you just download to your computer and transfer over to the reader . since you can basically use an iphone like an electronic reader -LRB- i have another friend who does that here -RRB- , i suspect there should be no problem using them with either pc or mac formats . but check online to be sure . just my two cents : they are so much better than books !!! cheaper to buy individual texts , much easier to travel with ... i got tired of waiting for a decent bookstore to come to this country . it never will . so cut out the middle man and just do it this way . only wish i had gotten mine sooner !

about personal loans
what would the bank do if some expats who happens to have personal loans at a certain bank here , then decided to go home and never come back ?
re : about personal loans
i think those loans up to a certain amount are insured with the insurance companies and banks will get their money back from the insurance .
re : about personal loans
sorry , i forgot to ask . why you are interested in such an issue ? is it only curiosity ?
re : about personal loans
if you leave qatar without paying your personal loan , definitely a case will be filed against you then you will be blacklisted in the immigration . you should never visit qatar again or else you 'll land in the prison cell . yes , personal loans are insured but bank ca n't recover it thru default or non payment . insurance is for life only , meaning applicable only if the borrower died .
re : about personal loans
there are banks here that is also available in your country even if you will not come back they have authorize agencies to confiscate whatever you have in your country
re : about personal loans
first of all such acts is non recommendable , by the way all banks are having very strong networks all over the world , they will trace the person out whereever he is , then u can imagine what they will do , and secondly within middle east they will black list the person and they will make the persons life miserable .
re : about personal loans
bank or any lending institutions extend such lending to you specially expats on the merit of your integrity thru your sponsor sometimes . they granted loans even they do not know you 100 % , and you should be thankful to such lending institutions . the first thing you should do is to go to the bank and settle everything or else you will be facing many consequences in the event you run away from such responsibility . there is a saying that says good karma begets good karma.bad karma will likewise begets bad karma . think about this .

where to buy a new computer ?

carrefour , jarir bookstore , pc one , sofitel area many choices to select from ... just visit , check for specs & prices and make a choice . regards !!
re : where to buy a new computer ?
i was very happy with pc one on salwa road . i did n't need any service sofar , but expect you will get the normal company service .
re : where to buy a new computer ?
i bought my laptop from jarir , after 8 mths the adaptor wont charge . i lost the receipt , then i brought it to jarir service centre , they checked the series number and replace the adaptor with the new one no question asked and no charge as well .
re : where to buy a new computer ?
pc one , jarir book store , villagio
re : where to buy a new computer ?
jarir book store and across the road offce one , pc one , city center there are many .
re : where to buy a new computer ?
if u are giving more importance to after sales service then i would recommend you to go to `` pcone '' in salwa road cause they have in-house service center , which is not only for warranty but also for any other it related work such as connection problems , driver problems etc . . just visit them and see good luck with ur new pc : -RRB-
re : where to buy a new computer ?
can check at emax electronics . they have opened one more showroom at al rayyan near family food center . it is having the best display of products , good collection also .
re : where to buy a new computer ?

re : where to buy a new computer ?
ok all , , , , but u can type some prices here , , , because this companies do n't have a web site to check online the prices ... thanks ...
re : where to buy a new computer ?
one more update . . ------------------- please be careful if you are buying from jarir , coz since they have installment system , they are seeling around 20 % than the market price to compensiate their interest . and they follow the same price even if u buy for cash . so please compare price with other shops before you buy it ... hope this helps : -RRB-
re : where to buy a new computer ?
pcone and jarir , they are very easy to talk to regarding after sales .

please answer
today we got visit visa for my aunt that is for one month but we requested for 6 months . would it be extendable upto 6 months , and what procedure is to be done and one more question would she have to undergo medical tests . your timely response is requested .
re : please answer
before the month ends , take the visa to the passport office . you can get it extended for another month .
re : please answer
1 . yes it is extendable for another 5months . .1 month + 5month = 6months . 2 . yes she has to go for medical test if she will stay for more than 30days in qatar .
re : please answer
if it is only a tourist visa it will not be extended your aunt has to go back on completion of 1 month.if not -LRB- like personal visit visa etc. -RRB- , then after 10-15 days of her arrival here you can take her to the health department located opposite to woqood petrol pump in abu hamour for some simple tests , the results of which will be given within 3 days and then you can go with that results to the immigration department located behind woqood petrol pump . . it 's done . . you can extend the visa upto 6 months @ 200 qar p.m.
re : please answer
a big thanks to all of you ! igot two good news today one visit visa for my aunt and second answer by soniya aapi .

where are migrating birds staying
i have seen lots of bird over doha during evening time . guess they migrate here in winter . does any one know which area -LRB- beach -RRB- they stay are staying ?
re : where are migrating birds staying
in nests on rental basis , hahahahahaha
re : where are migrating birds staying
always in transit .
re : where are migrating birds staying
on top of aspire tower
re : where are migrating birds staying
its a very genuine and interesting question.please respond seriously , if some one knows . don take everything as fun .
re : where are migrating birds staying
the reason birds migrate is that they are avoiding the cold weather brewing in the place they are staying so they move to warmer countries . there is a possibility they are just `` passing through '' doha when you noticed them . scientifically , birds can travel thousands of miles so it 's possible doha is not their final stop . they might have headed towards iran or beyond ... once they know that the weather in their place has warmed up , they go back .
re : where are migrating birds staying
i have heard , birds seen on dubai terminal , trying hard to caught up their next flight , therefore , security officers objected them lol , to proceed , guess what , lol no transit visa lol ,
re : where are migrating birds staying
juliarose , if u happen to look carefully , the birds are coming from iran -LRB- the north side -RRB- where the weather is more cold are going south to warmer / tropical climates . there are two types of migration : long-distance migration , & short-distance migration . as per my knowledge , some short-distance migrating birds stay in warmer regions of saudi arabia along the red sea coast ; whereas some more species travel to egypt , sudan and farther to ethiopia . for long-distance migration , birds fly as far as south africa too . more information can be found on wikipedia .

ticket vs ticket allowance
an offer i got from a company in qatar states that employee , spouse and 3 childern are entitled to annual vacation business class travel ticket allowance -LRB- market fare -RRB- . when i asked the hr about that item , they said that employee will either get the business class ticket or an economy class allowance . to me what they have said does n't go along with the offer . any body has more infromation about rules in qatar
as long as the business class travel ticket allowance is
stipulated in your offer , black and white , then you are standing on a solid ground to claim it or to require such be stipulated too in your employment contract . <a href="http://www.glitterfy.com/" target="_blank"> <img src="http://img10.glitterfy.com/graphics/35/tinkerbell_spoiled.gif" border="0"> <br /> glitterfy.com - glitter graphics </a> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bzutryir1m
there is no rules in qatar
there is no rules in qatar for the air ticket and stuffs . it will depend on the offer they provide to you . i mean what offer they mentioned in your labour contract . so as baldrick2dogs said , u can either cash out economy class fair or fly using a business class . simple !
i would suggest take the
i would suggest take the business class travel offer much better . . ----------------- he who dares wins
iata fair is 50 % more than
iata fair is 50 % + more than the normal fair , if my calculation is not wrong .
its ver clear
yv2r baldrick has replied very correct , if you want your company to issue a ticket , it will be business class or if you want to encash the ticket money you will get only economy fare . all airlines are approved by iata , means international air transport association , agents who have iata approval will follow rules and regulations , there are many agents who dosent have this iata , they give less price means , to survive in competitve market they share their comission what they get from iata agent with the passenger.dealing with approved iata agent is always beter .

nearly burst
i had a box of wine which went off . unfortunately the pressure in the box started building up so i had to pour it away before the thing burst . by this time it was undrinkable , although i tried to drink it . i did n't think qdc would have believed me if i had turned up with an empty box claiming my money back .

have rp + qatarid.need work permit . need help !
hi i am a british expat about to start working for a company that requires a work permit . i have been living in qatar for 3 months and have a valid residence permit and valid qatari id that expires in 2016 . i need a working permit now though . how do i go about applying for one ? thankyou !
work permit
for me an asian here 's what i have done - first fill up a work permit form from labor office -LRB- you can go to the office or from the web -RRB- fill it up in arabic and complete all the requirements listed at the back page -LRB- except the police clearance -RRB- - bring the completed work permit form with attachments to labor office and they will give you a schedule/endorsement letter for police clearance -LRB- they will not take your completed form or monetary payment unless you have the result of your police clearance -RRB- - after a week when you have the endorsement letter from labor office you have to go to police clearing office at salwa , fill up police clearance form with requirements listed at the back , you could wait for a week or two for the result . - lastly you have to go back to labor office with your 1 . completed work permit form with all the attachments -LRB- listed at the back -RRB- 2 . result of your police clearance 3 . payment and in the same day they will provide you with your work permit id or you can ask the company 's mandoop to do that for you -LRB- a lot easy :--RRB- -RRB-
ok thanx alot for the reply .
ok thanx alot for the reply.i dont want to work illegally . so i just have to get my father to type up a no objection letter and give it to my employer ? thanx in advance
work permit
- work permit qar500 - stamping your contract with english arabic translation qar 30 - police clearance + / - qar50 -LRB- i forgot , sorry -RRB- - spending on sending and receiving , to and from your country attested document copy -LRB- listed at the back of the form -RRB- , and attestation on doha -LRB- varies based on your country and their process i guess -RRB- cheers !
if you are under your fathers
if you are under your fathers sponsorship then you do n't need to change your sponsorship , you only need a no objection letter from your father allowing you to work . if you say you have a job lined up then your future employer will have to arrange the job contract and have it endorsed my the ministry of labour

re : tax on income ?
the government of qatar does not have income tax . your gross salary = your net salary . however , if your country has a tax treaty with qatar you may be liable for taxes in your home country . you can research this by googling this on the internet .

try salam plaza

i asked them the price of
i asked them the price of 1ds mark iii before . . i cost around 32k whereas in ebay or somewhere else , it only cost u around 25-36k . .
better to buy from the states .
if you are a serious buyer i can get it for you . right now 'm in virginia , states .
why not try the new nikon d3x
if he is going to spend around 32k , perhaps he is better off getting the new nikon d3x . it is in many respects more advanced -LRB- the canon has been out for a while -RRB- in terms of technology moving forward quickly . the only limitation is its high iso performance , perhaps limited and not as good as the d3 . by the way , what cameras are you guys using ? and lenses ? and ... .

hi ! i need a camera like
hi ! i need a camera like that because im a photojournalist , and im working for a newspaper . im covering a lot of events , and i need a `` top of the line '' camera . and no , im not yet in qatar , im be there soon , thats why im asking for help , i wanted to buy a new camera there , specifically a canon eos 1d mark iii 10.1 mp digital slr camera -LRB- body only -RRB- . even when i know everyone says its more expensive there , any help is welcome !
your decision
well photographer , the prices were mentioned in the earlier posts , now you make up your mind as to if you want to get it from outside or from here .
top of the line camera from
top of the line camera from canon is 1ds mkiii - i think not available in salam - the available camera is 1d mkiii -LRB- without `` s '' -RRB- and it cost around qr20 . or top ot the line from nikon d3x -LRB- also not seen in salam -RRB- - the available is d3 -LRB- without `` x '' -RRB- with almost similar price with canon 1d mkiii . it 's depend on your lens you have now - if you have canon lens then you should buy canon body . i do not know what kind of journalist are you - sport journalist or indoor journalist . for sport definitely nikon is the best , but for indoor canon much better . . but why did you buy g10 ? it is not for journalist -- i use g10 only for travelling - for documentation / photography i use my dslr . .
hey !
hi guys ! thanks for writting . well , somebody told me that i could get a mark 2 or 3 in a good price there in doha , buy i wasnt sure . now , reading your comments , and some stuffs in the web , i think its not such a good idea , its better to buy the mark 2/3 camera somewhere else , everyone says its too expensive there . but i will keep an eye open in my visit to doha , but fater all the comments ive been reading , my expectations are very low man !

hi ! the problem - from my point of view - is not getting one of those models there in doha , the thing is getting one in a good price . it seems to me that the prices for those models are very high there , thats why im saying im going there with very low expectations .

there are lots of online reviews of the netbooks you mention , most of which speak highly of the samsung , acer aspire one and hp mini . with these netbooks your personal preference of keyboard size , screen size , touchpad layout and battery life are more important than the processor speed , as they pretty much all use the same atom processor now . i recently bought the hp mini 2140 from lulu centre for qar 1388 , and i am very happy with it . it costs between us $ 450 to $ 550 online , so it seems like a good buy . note that the lulu one only has the 3 cell battery , which lasts around 2.5 hrs , vs the 6 cell battery with 5 hrs or more . the 6 cell battery can be purchased online for around qar200 if you need to use it for long periods without a power socket . a friend has three different netbooks and likes the samsung best . unfortunately for him , it had a heat failure and has been returned for repair . i also like the look of the aspire one and the toshiba , as they have slightly taller screens -LRB- 1024x600 vs 1024x576 on the hp -RRB- , and square touchpad . on the weekend i saw them at jarir bookstore -LRB- opposite ramada -RRB- with 6 cell batteries for qar1499 . i am thinking of getting one of these to try along side the 2140 , but just ca n't really justify having two . most likely your decision will come down to which one you think looks best , after all , they 're more of an accessory than a computer . they also come in red , with flowers , so get the right one , or you will have to buy a new handbag and pair of shoes ! jason

i guess only acer sells for 1500 . rest all are around 1800 - 2000 - 2500 range . i even read acer has one for around qr1000 . its obvious the resellers dont want to push the lower priced ones as it gives them lower margin . eg 10 % on 2000 = 200 -LRB- which is at least something -RRB- 10 % on 1000 = 100 -LRB- almost nothing -RRB-

been offered a job in qatar . .
hi everyone ! i have been offered a job in qatar but not really sure what to do as i think the salary is very low . it 's 3000 riyals a month . accommodation and transport are included in the employment package but i ca n't stop thinking about the salary for a full-time position . i also know that qatar is a very expensive country . what do you think ? thanks in advance !
you think the offer is low ?
you think the offer is low ? then forget it and look elsewhere . but , if you do n't have any higher offers yet , and has nothing to do with your time , why do n't you give it a try . ... listen to the sound of silence ...
need more info
whats the position , and what 's your nationality . pay is based on your race here . 3000 per month is a ridiculously low salary considering what the cost of living is . you 'd probably be living in a shack and be treated like dirt . shameful people offer such low salaries in a country with the highest per capita in the world .
... what is the position , what is ur situation
it depends on which position , , the questions in this forum is always incomplete , and the guys wanted us the readers to guess and reply !!!! if the job offer is for a officeboy / peon , the salary is good !!!! if you have no job at hand and really in desperate mood , the salary is good !!!!

i do n't mean to be
i do n't mean to be discouraging to you by any stretch but most people do n't just up and relocate to qatar . we are brought by specific companies for certain positions . that 's why westerners can be paid a considerable amount of money - they were recruited and hired from overseas because of a very particular set of skills/experience needed by a firm in qatar . when our contracts are over we will , nay must , however sadly return to our home countries . it is not a free-market economy . there are some generic recruiting agencies but your best bet is directly with a company that needs your specialized skill or a headhunter acting on that company 's behalf . if you have n't a skill that is in high demand -LRB- i.e. transplant surgeon -RRB- you will be competing for jobs with people from closer countries which traditionally tend to underbid their services . mandi

what is your profession on your rp ?
re : business visit to bahrain - visa on arrival
it is very easy to get a e visa . just go to google and enter visa for baherin and you will go to the site and you can get the visa sitting at your desk . the authorities are very cooperative and help tourist . how i wish qatar had such open policy for tourist who can come for 1 or 2 weeks to meet friends and relatives
re : business visit to bahrain - visa on arrival
i believe , irrespective of the profession in rp , your rp should be vlaid for minimum 6 months for you to get a visa on arrival to any other gcc countries . i do not want to confirm it , but this is what i heard . btw , i would advice you to talk to the bahraini embassy here in doha before planning your trip . - sak
re : business visit to bahrain - visa on arrival
gcc nations need atleast remaining 6 months valid visa , but sometimes there is excuses , on arrival visa is avialble for professionals .

the truth of interview
if you are going to attend one of an open day with qatar airways , you should bear on your mind that the most important thing for them to accept you as a cabin crew is the shine on your eyes . they do not expect from you to answer the all specific questions on a professional way . they just want to know that whether you are able to be a cabin crew -LRB- reaching 2.10 metres on your toes , no tattoo -RRB- and want to work with qatar airways . if you have the ability to impress people by your desire of being a cabin crew with qatar airways , then you are also able to impress the human r. managers at the interview . good luck !

visit the developers marketing offices . considering the state of the market - buyers , they 'll come to you . you can start with direct purchase with the developers at porto arabia , bahriyah , and other specific areas where expats are allowed freehold/leasehold properties . you can also look at the secondary market to buy properties already purchased . criteria - you need to have the funds to purchase and abide with their terms and conditions in the sale agreement .

never attempt to try it out
never attempt to try it out in the street other than the enclosure of your home . be it restuarant or hotel these moral police will exercising their ego jobs . if your friend have liqour permit why not ask him earlier on to buy few bottlse at qdc in anticipation of your coming .

hyundai or kia
car service center - which one is better ? hyundai or kia ? thanks for the serious answer .
re : hyundai or kia
kia !!!! but i am biased . everything about the kia is good - service centre , show room , the car !!!! especially the mohave ! seriously though , i went to get my kia serviced and was in and out within one hour ! they even offered us a hire car whilst ours was being serviced , but we chose to wait instead .
re : hyundai or kia
hyundai and kia . like lexus and toyota . kia is owned by hyundai . they both share technology , engine , transmission and electricals . just differ in looks . i know that kia spare parts are ridiculously expensive and available only in agency . hyundai is the best compared to kia .
re : hyundai or kia
neither ! both are korean cars and have poor resale value ... only my 2 cents worth advice .
re : hyundai or kia
when i been in korea in 2002 i asked some koreans what is the best local automaker by their oppinion ? all of them told me that it 's hyundai .
re : hyundai or kia
hyundai and kia are both controlled by the same korean parent . but japenesse cars like toyota have better quality . but if you had to pick choose between hyundai and kia pick hyundai . becouse also the resale price of kia is not good . hope the above helps : bye

lost/replacement qdc card
hi all , it seems i have lost my qdc card . or it was nicked from my car and some lucky guy is burning up my monthly limit . at any rate i need to get a new card . does anyone know the policy on lost/replacement cards ? do i just pay a fee and get a new one issued ? or do i have to jump through all the hoops again and pay the 1000 riyals ? i am going down there on saturday with my passport and a bucket full of hope . advice appreciated .
go back to qdc they will tell
go back to qdc they will tell you what to do picture on the card so that they can not sell any one if your picture is on the card also security is not allow the person into the shop if the picture is not matching with real one that is why they are taking picture when you renew your licence
u lost the card that mattered most
oh my . !!!!!!!! . . of all the cards you lost the one that mattered most ... looks like the festival must have been a dry one for you and the guys you shared it with
yes i am all broken up about
yes i am all broken up about it . i 'd appreciate it if you had some useful information to add . : -RRB-
for anyone who has this
for anyone who has this problem ... i found out that the qdc is happy to replace your card at no cost as long as you can bring your qatar id down to the shop . nice to see this is not a big hassle . i guess they want to make sure you can spend your money on booze and swine ! : -RRB-
qnb notes !!!! is it a good idea ??
what do you think about the qnb notes ?? is it a good idea for investment ?
re : qnb notes !!!! is it a good idea ??
dont know , whats a qnb note ?
re : qnb notes !!!! is it a good idea ??
qnb note is an investment product where the capital is guaranteed - so at the end of the investment period you are at least guaranteed your initial investment . the investment is linked to the performance of the qatar stock exchange over the next 2 years . obviously nobody knows how the stock market will do but i am pretty confident that over the next 2 years the investment should do better than the return on a fixed deposit inshallah ! so if you have an investment strategy that involves equities then this product has got little downside - principal guaranteed so if all else fails - its just the opportunity cost on the money for 2 years - versus the upside of the qatar stock market . dont need to be an einstein to figure this one out ...
re : qnb notes !!!! is it a good idea ??
you should be able to do the same by following these two simple steps , 1 . take 75 % of the total amount you want to put into this scheme into a high yielding fixed deposit scheme with any major like cbq . 2 . the remaining 25 % , invest in equities yourself . if the markets do well , you will make much more than you will with the notes , if the markets fare very badly , you will still have earned interest on the fixed deposit to offset the 25 % loss on your equity investment portfolio . rgds , j.j
re : qnb notes !!!! is it a good idea ??
my two bits are , , that min . investment is qar . 20 k for a tenor of 2 years . if u put 20 k in bank , u get max . 6 % per annum . . i think , that in two years . qe will give u at least return of 6 % p.a keeping in view , the qe at around 7300 nowadyas . . the worst scenario is that u will get your 20 k back after 2 years . . having invested directly in qe directly , i had burnt my hands . however , i still am in favour of qnb note 1 , due to its timings . as qe is still not gone too high .
re : qnb notes !!!! is it a good idea ??
i am also interested in this . . and like to know more about it . . i am watching :-RRB- . . please update more

i am visiting doha for 7 days
hey everybody , i am coming to doha , qatar to explore the possibilities of launching my international business consultancy on the 10th of may 2012 . i wanted to know if a 1000 qatari riyal would be sufficient for me to survive there decently for 7 days ? considerate and honest answers will be highly appreciated thank you dr. g
re : i am visiting doha for 7 days
you would need 1500 to cover decent food and travelling .
re : i am visiting doha for 7 days
look up the hotels in doha . most charge 1000 for one night !
re : i am visiting doha for 7 days
guys ... do n't discourage him.let him come and have a good time.he could find cheaper hotels for 150 riyals per night in some remote ares like national , souq area etc and have food decently with 75 riyals per day and 400 to 500 riyals for local shopping.site seeing and taxi rents will cost another 500 riyals.so all together qr .2500 approx.its more than enough for a decent stay .
re : i am visiting doha for 7 days
maybe he wanted to say 10000 and missed one zero lol . at that time it is enought . but 1000 nooooooooo wayyyyyyyy
qatar driving license will be valid in all gcc countries
hi all , i am having qatar driving license , will this license will be valid in all gcc countries ? if i get a job in uae , this qatar driving license will be valid in uae , or again i want to apply for driving license .
re : qatar driving license will be valid in all gcc countries
yes it is valid in all gcc countries . once you get the uae residency you go to the uae traffic department with the original qatari licence and copy too , you pay 100 dirhams and get the uae driving licence
re : qatar driving license will be valid in all gcc countries
if you are getting a job in any other gcc country then it means you 'll need to apply for a valid local dl in that country . if you are going to any gcc on a `` tourist '' base then yes it is valid . regards !!
re : qatar driving license will be valid in all gcc countries
i know that you can use a qatari driving license supported by your qatari rp to rent a car in the uae , but if you leave here to work there would imagine you need to do a test for the uae , unless your home license can be automatically transferred . should also imagine that once your rp is cancelled your qatari license irrespective of date on it would also be cancelled .
re : qatar driving license will be valid in all gcc countries
your qatar dl is valid in qatar & can be converted to omani license , bahrain , kuwait but not uae . u need give test in uae.if you fail u need to take classes opening file and keep trying your luck . getting uae license is not so easy as u get in qatar . u need good luck and if not u shed lot money in attempts . overall ur qatari license is not valid to get uae dl . u need to go through above process .
re : qatar driving license will be valid in all gcc countries
i got my driver 's licence in saudi arabia and when i transfered here in qatar , it was still valid for 2 months . i was able to convert it to qatar driver 's licence because saudi and qatar are part of gcc . i just do n't know if this is also applicable if you go out of qatar and convert it to uae driver 's license when you work there . but i have a strong feeling that it can be done since uae is also part of gcc .
re : qatar driving license will be valid in all gcc countries
i am from uae , having valid uae license , i confirm no other gcc or asian dl can be directly converted to uae dl . apply for a road test if u pass ur lucky.if u fail u need to take minimum 5 class . then try till u succeeded .

visa on arrival for managers
hi folks , my cousin intend to visit doha . he works in dubai and holds the visa of `` personnel manager '' . can anyone please advise if he can get visa on arrival ?
re : visa on arrival for managers
the state of qatar issues tourist visas on arrival for nationals of 33 countries : andorra , australia , austria , belgium , brunei , canada , denmark , finland , france , germany , greece , hong kong , iceland , ireland , italy , japan , liechtenstein , luxemburg , malaysia , monaco , new zealand , norway , portugal , san marino , spain , sweden , singapore , south korea , switzerland , the netherlands , usa , uk , vatican city . this service allows travelers or hotels to apply for a visa online ahead of time . applicants are required to supply a sponsor id in the application , which can be from a relative living in qatar or an id supplied by a hotel . citizens from outside the above countries should arrange for a tourist visa through a qatari embassy or hotel in qatar . source : hukoomi
re : visa on arrival for managers
i think gcc residents in managerial level can get visa on arrival .
re : visa on arrival for managers
i hope u that guy is eligible for visa on arrival , for confirmation you can take his paasport copy to paasport office near airport and cross check it

buying from ebay , newegg or tigerdirect , is it safe and shipment length and costs ?
hey qlers . i was wondering if i buy stuff from either ebay , amazon , newegg or tigerdirect , do i 100 % get the item or do some people scam me ? and how much time does it take to ship it to doha , and how much are the shipping charges ? say i buy something used from ebay , how can i ask it to ship it here as it does n't give an option for qatar .
re : buying from ebay , newegg or tigerdirect , is it safe ...
i buy from all three places plus mwave.com , zipzoomfly.com and amazon.com . i use bongo us mail forwarding as they consolidate shipments . with aramex , each parcel is shipped separately and there is a minimum charge . so if you buy a memory card that weighs next to nothing you pay $ 30 or so . i believe aramex then charges about $ 8 us per pound for heavier parcels . bongo consolidates - gathers all your parcels and weighs them as if they were one . they ship all your parcels as one shipment . you will save hundreds of dollars over a year of shipments . i have gotten shipments that i have paid only $ 6 a pound for and saved on consolidation . check them out they are fantastic . http://www.bongous.com/parcel_forwarding.php aramex should wake up and provide consolidation services . dhl is also laughable as they do not consolidate . fedex is never going to do that as they make too much on commercial shipments .
re : buying from ebay , newegg or tigerdirect , is it safe ...
hey , i know that www.qbay.com -LRB- the ebay site for qatar -RRB- will be available but i do n't know when . someone was telling me that it will be very safe because you need to enter your qatar mobile number into the site and then varify your identity with an sms code . clever stuff ?? it will keep the scammers away im sure
re : buying from ebay , newegg or tigerdirect , is it safe ...
thanks for the answers guys . just wanted to confirm that aramex is safe ...
re : buying from ebay , newegg or tigerdirect , is it safe ...
i am a permanant ebay shopper . i would advise you to always check the feedback of the seller . do n't buy if the seller 's positive feedback is lower than 99 % .

kuwait travel by road
hi all , i have plan to go to kuwait city with my own car . i got confirmation from one of hotel in kuwait that they can arrange visa for me . does any body know the route to go to kuwait ? 2 years back i was travel to bahrain also by road and i know dammam and i believe if i want to go to kuwait i have to pass by dammam right ? thanks .
re : kuwait travel by road
yes you have to pass by dammam , i 'm planning to visit kuwait by car as well , can u advise the name of the hotel that arranged the visa and how much does it cost
re : kuwait travel by road
thanks sanishazi . you can check this website and communicate with them : http://www.moevenpick-hotels.com/en/pub/your_hotels/worldmap/kuwait/overview.cfm the cost for visa is 8kd / passport . how is road condition ? i use travel outside qatar with my car every holiday session but i dont have much information about itinerary road to kuwait . kuwait is the only gcc country that i have n't visit yet by road .
re : kuwait travel by road
reaching dammam means half of the way and the most complicated part has passed ... just go north to jubail road and follow the signs ... the road is good . . by the way , visa can be obtained based on your job title either on the border or airport . . same as dubai .
re : kuwait travel by road

re : kuwait travel by road
hi momo - i asked kuwait embassy staff here and they told me that i must get the visa before enter to border land eventhough my rp title is mohandis . if travel by plane is ok i can get the visa on arrival but for travel by road little different . but it 's ok now since hotel can arrange the visa . hi remy - there is no special requirement . the movenpick hotel kuwait just give me the form and i need to fill-up and sent it back to them and pay the fee using credit card -LRB- 8 kd/passport -RRB- . after i get the kuwait visa then i need to apply ksa transit visa . once we get ksa transit visa then halas we can travel to kuwait by road .

habibti facial threading would cost you around 90-100 rials per month plus it is very painful & disturbing to see the pimples appearing on face thereafter but if you go to plastisurgi for laser treatment for facial hair removal they 'll charge you around 500 for full face laser which includes the neck area too & the pain is very minimal as compared to threading & the hair would get back only after 6/7 months depending upon the thickness of your hair .

what is there to do during ramadan ?
hello , i just moved from the us to doha yesterday and since it 's ramadan i do n't know what to do ! i hear that all restaurants/stores/etc . are closed ... what 's there to do for fun/shopping/eating during the day ? thank you !
re : what is there to do during ramadan ?
all those sound quite boring ... : /
re : what is there to do during ramadan ?
well , it 's a tough time to arrive , that 's for sure ! there are western-oriented places that can be visited during the day , but you 'll have to remember that there is no eating , drinking , smoking or gum-chewing allowed while out during the day . that said , here are a few places i know that are open at least for a little while , each day and then also in the evenings . carrefour - 9 a.m. - 1 a.m. sat-thurs - villagio & city center megamart - 8:30 a.m. - 1 a.m. sat-thurs - landmark , the centre just about all the malls are open from 10 a.m. to around 1 or 2 and then re-open around 8 in the evening , so you can get a few hours of shopping in during the day and then go back at night if you run out of time . i understand the iftar buffets are marevelous and served at most hotels . that would be your late evening meal , and well worth the wait from what i 'm told -LRB- i 've only been here since late july , so i have n't had a chance to do all the ramadan things offered yet -RRB- find a reliable taxi driver , and you 'll be all set to pop around to the various malls to get better acclimated to the area . once the heat eases off in a couple months , it would be easier to get around by getting a drop off at a central location and then walking around the city a bit . get a marhaba at a bookstore if you do n't already have one ; it is the best resource for all this kind of stuff ! have fun !
i love you
i love you ... you love me ... we are one big happy family ... why is ql so boring ? all are welcome to hijack this thread and discuss about anything under the sun but plz keep it clean -RRB- no cat fights please .

why qatari men dont queue ? does the law allow them to do so ?
i have been to few official places such as bank and medical centre and while waiting in a queue to be served , saw qatari men just arriving and going right to the front of the queue and managing to get served immediately ! this is so unfair ! is this type of behaviour common and accepted in this country ?

new cuisine ? in heart of doha ...
have you think of anything but food ? are there any special food , delicacies or cuisine that you have been looking for but you ca n't find it in doha . this is an opportunity to share your thoughts and bea part of a new creation = -RRB-

egg/omlet paratha specially available in bombay ... the list is huge and i m fasting ...

heavens n eggs = -RRB-
there 's one resto that 's called heaven 's n egg , all kinds of eggs but a universal menu as well ... what 's paratha ? sorry to temp you about food =-LRB- a few more days and its already done , eid is coming .
dhal bhati ?
what 's dhal bhati ? need to research more on this food = -RRB-
it is one of the most
it is one of the most popular unleavened flat-breads in indian cuisine and is made by pan frying whole-wheat flour on a tava . -LSB- 2 -RSB- the paratha dough usually contains ghee or cooking oil which is also layered on the freshly prepared paratha . -LSB- 3 -RSB- parathas are usually stuffed with vegetables , such as boiled potatoes , radishes or cauliflower and/or paneer -LRB- south asian cheese -RRB- . a paratha -LRB- especially a stuffed one -RRB- can be eaten simply with a blob of butter spread on top but it is best served with pickles and yoghurt , or thick spicy curries of meat and vegetables . some people prefer to roll up the paratha into a tube and eat it with tea , often dipping the paratha into the tea ... btw ... omlet stuffed paratha square in shape ... available in bombay .
salax85 ... lol . .

car key with a chip ? can i get a second one made ?
hi all i 've a nissan pathfinder and i need a second key made , but the regular key shops can only make keys that unlock the doors but not start the car . the nissan dealer charges around qr 300 to make a second key . is there any other place where i can get a second key made for lesser that can be used to start the vehicle ? thanks a lot for looking and answering .
re : car key with a chip ? can i get a second one made ?
bro , try industrial area street no 1 called salam keys -LRB- by the petrol pump besides mannai -RRB- . they make computerised keys , they can make a key which will start the engine . cheers ,
re : car key with a chip ? can i get a second one made ?
u ill have to oder keys through ur car agency by courrier they can do it immediately , it happened to me once i have audi s6 and i lost keys in the gass ... . . and i had to leave my car parked at corniche for 8 days . cheers .
re : car key with a chip ? can i get a second one made ?
there is a key shop next to the doha bank opp mecurre -LRB- sofitel -RRB- hotel down town , you could try him , he does some electronic keys not all
re : car key with a chip ? can i get a second one made ?
there are a bunch of keysmiths along sofitel street -LRB- if you are coming from souq najada -RRB- . they charged me 200 riyals for the key . you can bargain some more to avail lesser price .
re : car key with a chip ? can i get a second one made ?
after i got the duplicate key from the agency it was still to be shaped in a key shop . i went to a shop in industrial area petrol station -LRB- street number 2 -RRB- opposite mercedes . i was told by the person there that he have the same machones like the agency and i would have saved if i came to him first , , , try there .
re : car key with a chip ? can i get a second one made ?
your key is purposely made to have a code for security reasons . it would be better to have it ordered to a nissan dealer , and not somewhere else . but if you dont mind having ur key code known by others , you can get a cheaper service somewhere else .
re : car key with a chip ? can i get a second one made ?
dealer only .

al khor to dukhan road
anyone who travels from al khor to dukhan or vice versa ? what 's condition of the road like ? is it a busy road ? and i was wondering how safe it would be like to be travelling alone , esp . for a female driver . appreciate any response .
long way
it will take u like 2 hours . u have to take the north road or the one to golf club first , then drive doha to dukhan . depends on the hours you may will get some traffic . are you planning to do this every day or just one weekend ??? if its everyday move from al khor . there is no problem for female drivers , i believe you drive better than any of those bus drivers or pick up drivers ... the venezuelan sensation !!!
boring and long drive
its a very long drive ... whew ! thinking of it makes me feel lazy and sleepy ! the road going to dukhan is under construction so you should be extra cautious on driving specially at night.becoz there are some areas w/o lights . it is safe for everyone , but like i said just be careful . and yeah i also suggest that if you 'll do this everyday , might as well move in to dukhan or at least doha ... you are talking about approximately 150-160kms kms drive in one way alone ! <a target="_blank" href="http://www.blingcheese.com/"> <img src="http://i153.photobucket.com/albums/s235/revmyspace2/graphics/brand/cars/cars_9_aavd.gif" title="myspace comments" border="0"> </a> <br> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.blingcheese.com/"> mysp
i am travelling to dukhan
i am travelling to dukhan and back to doha on a daily basis and i do n't find any problem with that . in fact the road is much more convenient now that they have finished most of the road works . but i 'd like to know the road condition from al khor to dukhan and back to al khor . i understand that it would take almost the same time like doha-dukhan ... thanks
its just an hour drive to dukhan from doha !
those who said it takes 2 hrs to get to dukhan from doha were wrong . however , the drive itself is boring . it was safe even on the previous service road but now that most of the road works is near completion , driving there should be fun . i myself would go to dukhan very soon before chilling winter begins ... lol ******************************************* freedom is the right of all sentient beings
what is there in dukan any
what is there in dukan any fun thing ot watch during weekend tirp for those who have not been there ?
all of the above are talking
all of the above are talking about al khor to dukhan via doha but i remember there is a direct route to dukhan from al khor through jamaliya which is shorter and around 45 minutes drive . ban spoon feeding not me
right charan .
joan you get on north road dont drive towards doha drive towards north about 15km you will notice a petrol pump and police station on your left side there is a turn to zubara before the police station . get on that road to zubara keep driving till you see another left turn ghawriya its a on that road keep driving till you reach the dead end thats in jamiliya take right go straitght for 2 minutes another dead end take left turn there and drive for 25min its a free road with no heavy traffic on it you will land on dukhan road you take right turn and dukhan is just 10mins away from you . that all drive will take you around 70-80min . if you go via doha will take you long 2 hours for sure . <img src="http://images.cooltext.com/155194.gif">

dual sim mobile phones in qatar
hi , can someone tell me which are the available phone models which has dual sim facilities , and how i could get my hands on one of those ... got a vodafone sim - need to use it with the ol' qtel sim , in one phone . cheers
re : dual sim mobile phones in qatar
i am using samsung dual sim mobile for the last 2 years and it works perfect . contact samsung dealers .
re : dual sim mobile phones in qatar
call 5869478 or sms he will provide you dual sim iphone .
re : dual sim mobile phones in qatar
mega mart behind the ramada are selling dual sim card phones from china . they are good but little expensive . the same phones are cheaper in dubai . i have been using one for 8 months with no problem . price was approx 600aed with tv 660aed
re : dual sim mobile phones in qatar
hey guys , thanks for the answers . just a couple of questions ; 1 . the samsung & the chinese phones - do they have `` real '' dual sim capabilities . ie . can you use both sim cards simultaneously or do you have to switch between the 2 networks allowing you to operate only on 1 sim at a time 2 . do the chinese phones come with warranty ? is it easy to replace parts / gt it serviced etc . . thanks again guys cheers
re : dual sim mobile phones in qatar
china dual sim phones : no warranty is provided for any china phones ; no spare parts seen yet except for battery , charger and cables ; with proper care , they can last a good time ; most china dual sims are with tv , radio , cam , etc. , if you are on a budget , this fones will do
re : dual sim mobile phones in qatar
i will speak for the samsung shg d880 . the following is from its user manual guide : ---------------------------------------------------- sim card switching your phone supports the dual sim cards mode , enabling you to use two sim cards at the same time without changing them . activate sim cards and select the primary sim card . 1 . in the idle mode , press the swithching button at the left side of the phone . 2 . scroll to the sim card you want to use and select enable or primary . 3 . press -LCB- options -RCB- and select save . if you change the primary sim card , the phone automatically turns off and back on . ** you can use browser , e-mail , multimedia messages , and stk applications services only with the primary sim card . ---------------------------------------------------- as far as i 'm concerned with my phone , it does n't need restarting since the sim from my country is only used to receive sms messages and not for calls . that works for me just fine . you can always go to the store bringing with you one qtel and one vodafone sim cards and you can try it for yourself before you decide to buy .
re : dual sim mobile phones in qatar
paul henson , i have 3 dogs , been with them for 1.1 / 2 now and very very happy . they even offer kennels service but i found their kennels to be small . phone : 4216405 , they are located somewhere opposite villagio . good luck .
re : dual sim mobile phones in qatar
i have used the lg dual sim for a short while ... troublesome as it keeps getting stuck . i am not aware of any that is perfect to use at the moment . just go to a telephone shop and they will show you the phone . good luck .

whether u plan to leave or
whether u plan to leave or not , the most important thing is that your girlfriend gets proper medical care , take her to a private clinic where they will not ask for a marriage certificate , so at least she is prescribed with the proper medication a pregnant woman should be taking , the first couple of months in a pregnancy are the most important ! good luck anyways :-RRB- <img src="http://www.qatarliving.com/files/images/qlip_0.jpg">

guys : they go all in packs to
guys : they go all in packs to awkward places like that stinky coffee shop opposite to ramada . they talk about their cars and about their connections in qatar . . just like italians talk in the us about their families . . when they see any girl moving , their eyes pop out , their tongues drop on the floor and they eye-rape the poor girl until she disappears . girls : they sit down and just text . they would be on a table with celebrities but they have their phones out and they just go at it as if iphone or blackberry are brad pit 's testicles at his prime . when guys talk to them , they mostly give that nasty look , even if they do like it deep down . they have to give the impression that they are not desperate . those who are `` cool '' go out to the fabulous night life in doha . w , which is ok . seven , is where lebs compete on who looks the most like antonio banderas in desperado . they are all bad boys . they walk as if their mothers were bred by dragons and not regular men . they are still stuck in 1993 when it comes to their fashion , their jelly hair , levis501 jeans and dare to tell them it is time for a change . british guys , mostly fat ones , have 4 drinks and they start picking up fights with our good old egyptian friends or any other inferior nationality -LRB- inferior because of the work-visa system here -RRB- girls ' main mission at clubs is `` get drinks for free '' , they could be sitting with any degenerate that has money . they are fully aware of the male-female ratio that works to their advantage , and they act accordingly . if you want to pick up ladies , you got ta go out . does not matter what you look like , just dress nice , talk outta your bum and pretend you own everything and you will get to change the oil . another way to spend time , is to just eat and sleep . you will end up looking like a para-shout in 2 years , lose some hair , and become a heavy smoker who 's breath and farts smell very similar . i hope this helps . it sucks but i am starting to get in the game .
location of doha public prosecution
hi every one could you ples tell me the location of public prosecution in doha .
i think that is in west bay
i think that is in west bay behind salam plaza .
location of doha public prosecution
hi im in near al-saad plza . i want to go to public prosecution in doha . somebody told me it is near al-dafna area , sharaton r/a , lebanese school . is that correct
it 's in westbay area , behind
it 's in westbay area , behind the gate mall , near dunes hotel .
if you are coming from al saad ,
go travel going to city center , the prosecutors office is in the same road of the back of city center but on the other side . so you can take a u-turn at the corner of city center and turn right on the first street -LRB- after making the u-turn -RRB- . from the corner , approximately 200 meter . actually you wo n't miss it since it is the only building with iron metal barricades and the parking within the area is full . your landmark will be , the islamic bank at one corner of the building itself .

can you answer please
i already resign to my company and planning to go back to my country because i ca n't transfer to another much better company because they do n't give noc . my question is , can i demand my company to provide me free ticket going back to my country because of the reason they do n't give noc and i was locally hired here in qatar .
re : can you answer please
yes . company must give u a ticket . that is according to qatar labour law . whether u hired locally or internationally . since u dont get noc u still under ur company ... if u didnt get the ticket u have the total rights to goto labour dept or a police near to u. inshasllah they will help u. may allah guide the officers working for ministries to make labours more comfortable than helping the companies to use them as they wish ... all the best
re : can you answer please
yes . you can ask . read your employment contract . in our company it doesnt matter you resigned or they terminate they will provide me a ticket to fly back home .

copy pasted story : a man was on his death bed , someone asked him to give some wise counsel before he departed the world and he said : `` when i was young i wanted to change the world and solve its problems , as i got older i realized that perhaps i should lower my sights , i thought i would be better served in changing my country . as time went on i realized that people of my country could not be changed . i decided to change the people of my town , but they also did not wish to change , when i reached my old age i thought i would try changing my family , here also i found my endeavors go to waste , try as i might my family members would not change . `` now that i am on my death bed , i have realized that if i had sought to improve myself , and removed my own defects , then perhaps my family members would have been influenced . then seeing the behavior of my family people of my town would have been influenced . by seeing the spiritual change and improvement of the people of my town , the people of my country would have been influenced . and perhaps through the people of my country the world may have been influenced .

randomguy yes i have a
randomguy yes i have a thought about your thought too . the laws of qatar is very strange as compared to other places , we all know that . here you can get away with murder and get prison time for running a street light . what is the definition of crime ? an act of breaking the law . yes there sometimes is need to differentiate between what is acceptable and what is not , here the crime is not being committed by the ladies alone , its the men that pay for their services as well . there are crimes that hurt others and here they seem to not mind selling their bodies and having a `` blast '' just coz they are getting gifts and having an easy life , so what ? keep in mind prostitution is the oldest `` profession '' , so if they have no problem in providing this service to better their life then i dont think anyone has the right to question their motives or morals .

i do n't know friedunicorn , but i doubt he is jealous of not being with a disease ridden prostitute . plus that is just a lazy response that a 5 year old gives when you question them , or take affront to a particular action `` you 're just jealous that it is not you '' . really ? so people can not be disgusted and outraged by something without being jealous . okay ... weak argument , and avoids giving a solution .

jealous guy
well the guy sounds to be jealous that they seem to be having a good time . maybe they would be willing to share their tida with him and he could drive them around and take care of his needs too once in awhile
ahhh fu , you know me

fu how you know that they are making big money ...
... how it could be possible in a strict qatar ???

street cornered
in my company , most of the women are bankrolled by a qatari . nice cars , nice phone , given some pocket money -LRB- hush money -RRB- , and have to be available when the guy slides up in his land cruiser and wants some extra marital loving . is this prostitution ? the line is blurred , right ? they would say they are in a loving relationship ... and they live , drive and eat beyond their means . it is why they came to the country , to snare a rich qatari . if you report these women , they 'll just deny and say it is their boyfriend , and that the money is a ` gift ' .
qhris - but cid can prove
qhris - but cid can prove that they have multiple boyfriends.isn ' t it ? multiple boyfriends giving ` gifts ` is still prostitution .
who cares ?
are ther bothering you ? flan 's comment rings true .

omg ... . how could it be ... ... ... . fried unicorn ... man unbelivable ... is it gift ... ? then the rules says it is huram here !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

hey i know , i am not condoning it . it is why my company has tightened up the visiting rules -LRB- although they will deny it , and say it was just for ` our safety ' -RRB- ; a constant stream of men entering the accommodations to visit particular women . i do n't know if cid would bother . if these people are advertising then it is a problem , if they are discreet then the country probably does n't even care . which is a contradiction , obviously .

there is open prostituion in
there is open prostituion in some of the bars here mainly for expat use ... and then there is locals ` dating ' expat women on the side while their wives are at home and providing them with a flat and money ... the first one is easy to stop as the police know its going on but choose to do nothing , the second is more difficult and much more controversial ... the local police are probably doing the same things themselves ...
do n't they prostitutes marry
do n't they prostitutes marry the guy first and then get divorced as soon as the deed is done ? besides , so long as they are here of their own free will and getting a decent wage they are performing a valuable service to this predominately male society . the uae is full of them . at least they seem to be more discrete here .

is it okay to take vitamin c or panadol for pregnant women ?
my best friend suspects that she is pregnant . at the same time she has fever . is it okay if she will take vitamin c or panadol ?
re : is it okay to take vitamin c or panadol for pregnant ...
panadol is considered safe during pregnancy . vitamin c wo n't do anything for a cold , so it 's best not to take when you might not know what else is in it .
re : is it okay to take vitamin c or panadol for pregnant ...
just consult with doctor .
re : is it okay to take vitamin c or panadol for pregnant ...
panadol yes ... vit c. . . yes . but , it is always recommended to consult a doc or at least the pharmacist .
re : is it okay to take vitamin c or panadol for pregnant ...
think she should take paracetamol not panadol-check
re : is it okay to take vitamin c or panadol for pregnant ...
panadol = paracetamol = acetaminophen . good quality vitamin c is ok , too .
re : is it okay to take vitamin c or panadol for pregnant ...
generally all kind of medications taken during pregnancy should be consulted with the doctor , this does not mean that you can not take any medication . . pandol is genrally safe and well as vit c
re : is it okay to take vitamin c or panadol for pregnant ...
yes it is safe to take panadol and vitamin c during pregnancy . but if you are already taking prenatal vitamins then skip vitamin c. .
re : is it okay to take vitamin c or panadol for pregnant ...
i think this should be a question for a doctor , not for people you do n't know on a forum !
how is the salary range for a better life in qatar
my husband got an offer from a qatar construction company with a salary of 2500 qar + accomodation . please let me know it is a good offer or not . also , is the family status possible with this salary and what is the minimum salary for family status ?
re : how is the salary range for a better life in qatar
what is his job & position he received this offer then we can comment . but still you ask about the family living in qatar i will tell you some facts . as per the present rule your salary should be more than 7000 qr . then only you can apply for family visa . if you want to hire a single bedroom appartment in qatar you have to pay minimum 5000 qr . living expenses for a bachelor will be minimum 700/800 qr . per month -LRB- i think -RRB- , then family you can imagine . qatar is very expensive . before going to accept any offer from here please re-think twice . is that suitable for you ? or consult with any friends or relatives living in qatar . all the best .
re : how is the salary range for a better life in qatar
family not possible . \ accept or reject offer as per ur financial condition and job designation . for labour salary is around 800 qr along accomodation . average salary for sacretary is around 4000 qr . therefore , think and decide as per ur condition . normal skilled person can get easily more then 7000 qr .

background checks on teachers / staff etc
i am just wondering if anyone knows how teachers and school staff are checked out in doha ? if a school follows the british curriculum does that mean they woild carry out similar background and criminal checks etc ? i will obviously ask the schools this but wanted to get everyones view . thanks v
well that 's certainly not
well that 's certainly not true at the universities . all degrees are checked and a cpmplete background and security check is done -LRB- not just a police certificate . -RRB- it is very thorough and should be . mandi
this is actually massively
this is actually massively worrying that they are not doing background/police checks !! i mean ... its really worrying , not knowing what sort of person is teaching your child . i mean you see it often in the uk , teachers who have been arrested on child pornography charges , and this is with the police checking !!
my partner did comment on
my partner did comment on how ` trusting ' the nursery appeared compared to the uk where a newly employed person cant be left with kids without being supervised by existing staff for several months . best thing to do is ask the place what they do and visit it to get a feel .
vikwa
no , teachers over here are taken purely on cv and interview . there are no police checks done in most cases . most schools say they do checks but as qatar has no juridisction , how can they ? as i say , they do n't do checks and neither do they check qualifications -LRB- that 's in certain schools -RRB- . anybody that can prove otherwise , feel free .

re : mozaic tv
the internet connection which comes with mozaic tv is fairly good and relatively continuous . the speed vary all the time depending upon the use of internet of the other customers . anyway , it is the best you can get for this amount . the quality of tv programs is worse than what you can have with a simple digital receiver -LRB- costs about 120 qr and 0 qr per month -RRB- . furthermore , the numbers of channels provided by mozaic -LRB- without any extra package included -RRB- is very restricted , compair to above mentioned receiver .

acs doha
we are relocating from south africa in july and i have literally applied to all the british and american schools for my 4 years son and been refused by each of them . we have however been lucky to get a spot at acs doha . i know its a new school , but has anyone heard anything about it and is there confirmation of whether they follow american or british curriculum ?
best thing to do is give the
best thing to do is give the school a try and get your son on other school 's lists as soon as possible . if it turns out you like acs , then no harm done .
my my , i know this
<p> my my , i know this discussion is a bit old but stumbbled on it today ... ag shame the lady only wanted to know if anyone has some constructive , true advise to give her . you have obviously nothing better to do than to carry on and on and on with this . . you need to get a life and a break from qatar mate/s !!!! </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> ek is so jammer dat jy al die gemors van die mense hier in doha moet hoer ... jy sal in die einde jou eie besluit moet maak . . sorry my afrikaans is not so fantastic anymore so i will carry on in english ... -LRB- apology for presuming that you do speak it and you do n't ... -RRB- . . just something to make them wonder !!! heheh </p> <p> to answer your question ... it follows the american system and the ib - programme . make sure that if your company are paying the fees that they will cover it ... yes there are some schools better than others . . but hey it all depends on where you will be living as the traffic here is quite incredible . . so you will have to maybe plan around that . . have a look on this site to see a list of all the international schools - http://www.onlineqatar.com/education/international-schools.aspx&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> <p> i am asuming you already have done that ... and yes others are more difficult to get into than others . . but if you put your name down at all the schools that you are interested in , you have to pay a registration fee and you do n't get that back if you decide not to go to that school . . so it is a hard one this . . i will hope that all goes well with you !!! you are more that welcome to contact me again . good luck !!!! </p>
please judge based on evidence or personal experience
it 's that time of the year when new comers to qatar begin exploring schools for their children . good luck with it all . it is not an easy process . but i think it would be more helpful if people spoke from personal experience and based on evidence . impressions and second hand information can be misleading . btw , my kids go to sherborne , and i am pleased with it . i do n't think it will be comparable to the dorset school . it ca n't be , and i do n't judge it on that basis . i judge it on the curriculum , staff , activities , interaction with parents , etc. as for fees , while it is not cheap , it is less expensive than compass , asd , and acs doha . i think dess is subsidized , right ? good luck with acs and when you 've gone through the experience , please write about it . i am sure many people will want to know .
dohaexplorer -- do you know
<p> dohaexplorer -- do you know much about sherborne 's association with the boarding school in england ? is the campus in doha essentially a branch or is it just licensing the name ? </p>
dintovich ... what do you mean
dintovich ... what do you mean about `` being honest '' ? i have nothing to hide whatsoever . and we are very happy with the school my children go to , i have no reason to consider change . but , if i were , then `` rich kids '' would certainly not be a deterrent for me . although , except for some qatari children , i have not seen any rich kids here .
you are right kiwinyc . it
you are right kiwinyc . it seems like dintovitch does have a very large chip indeed which makes me suspicious about how genuine the comments are . perhaps the fees are too high for them , or their kids did not get in when they applied or they are they elsewhere and are worried about some of these new up and coming schools taking away students . might go and have a look at sherborne myself so there is your answer dintovitch , my children are not at sherborne but i have heard many good things about it . now answer expatlady .
in a court of law the judge
in a court of law the judge does not examine the motives of why a witness says this or that but looks at what has been said ; is it or could it be true or false ? if we start on the road of why somebody says something or another we will end up nowhere . i could for example retort by asking why , you out there , are you trying to protect sherborne-qatar and i could go into theorizing about you perhaps being british and want to protect your national school or your kids are in that school and you want to justify your decision for taking them there or many large number of possible motives . if we go along this road there will be no end to the discussion . let us instead try to be rational and confine ourselves to facts and not to what is in the hearts and can not be seen . it does n't really matter whether i have a chip on my shoulder or not -LRB- you will never find out -RRB- , what matters is ; what i have said about sherborne-qatar , is it or could it be true or false ? this is what we should look at . also , when i say `` spoilt rich kids '' i do n't mean they are spoilt because they are rich per se , no , those unfortunate kids are the kind that have been brought up mostly not by their parents but by the maids -LRB- not even trained nannies -RRB- who are in the palaces . and regarding this point the same will apply to acs doha . another point needs clearing ; i did not say that sherborne-qatar is bad as teaching goes -LRB- but it could be bad for your kid because of the demographics . -RRB- i said that it will never be like sherborne-uk because the raison d'etre for sherborne-qatar is different from that for sherborne-uk . sherborne-qatar has shareholders who will siphon money away from it unlike sherborne-uk . please also remember that sherborne-uk is only a secondary boarding school which means sherborne is new in the primary school field . why did they start with primary school in qatar ? is it because it is a bigger market ?
sherborne prep in dorset was
sherborne prep in dorset was established in 1858 for students from aged 3 - 13 years - therefore i think they have some primary school experience . it runs alongside sherborne boys and sherborne girls senior schools . they also have an international school in the uk which prepares overseas students for entry into their main schools . the schools are both day and boarding . there is a clear understanding and acceptance that sherborne qatar wishes to establish its own identity whilst keeping some of the values from the ` mother school .
if you google `` sherborne prep
if you google `` sherborne prep in dorset '' you will find that it has nothing to do with the 560 years old sherbone-uk . it just has the name sherborne by virtue of being in sherborne town . if you visit sherborne-uk website you will find that the only link they have is sherborne-qatar . also the schools ' logos are different . as for the international school that prepares overseas students for entry into the main sherborne , i know nothing about and i do n't know whether it even exists . if it does i am sure it is totally separate from the main sherborne that we know . it could be a private school that has thought of exploiting the niche of preparing students to the main sherborne . so , i stand by what i said earlier that they have not managed a primary or a prep school before ! i am not saying this makes then inadiquate , no , i do n't know about that , but just that they were willing to undergo such an experience for the sake of financially supporting sherborne-uk . you will get just as good an education , if not better for your kids somewhere else , cheaper and without being hit by the demographics i mentioned earlier .
wow . i did n't realize .
wow . i did n't realize . thanks for the post dintovitch .
not only that it will never
not only that it will never be the same as sherborne in the uk because of the spoilt rich kids but also because here in qatar sherborne is for profit unlike its sister in the uk because a -RRB- they have a qatari partner to whom they should pay dividends and b -RRB- part of the extra money they make goes to support the true sherborne in the uk which is facing some financial difficulties ; why do you think they are here in the first place !? you are right angelinaballerina , sherbornr-qatar can never be as sherborne-uk . all in all i think sherborne-qatar will mar the name and the old academic tradition of sherborne-uk .
dintovich , i have children in
dintovich , i have children in school here . i have not seen many `` spoilt , rich kids '' that mar the reputation of our school ... what kind of people are you actually talking about ???
whatever next ` oxford
whatever next ` oxford university qatar ' ?? shrewsbury school qatar ?? marlborough college qatar ... . nahhhh ...
/ - a-t - / nomerci look , all i
@ nomerci look , all i am saying is that the raison d'etre for sherborne-qatar is not the same as that for sherborne-uk for which you have taken your child in the first place . sherborne-qatar was originally founded in order to provide dividends for its founders and shareholders ; the qatari plus shareborne-uk . really there are better and cheaper schools with less pompous names such as dess that was founded just for the benefit of the students who study in it and no one else . but unfortunately many prefer to brag about their kid who is studying at sherborne-qatar .
hey nomerci , where were your
hey nomerci , where were your children before you took them to sherborne-qatar ?
dinovitch , ok , i have no idea
dinovitch , ok , i have no idea about that school , so i take your word for it . although , i know of a few parents and students who seem to like the school .
thank you nomerci for being
thank you nomerci for being honest ! good luck to your children wherever they are but do n't take them there !
where do your children go to
where do your children go to school dintovitch
they are well-established in
they are well-established in the uk - you can see their website here http://www.acs-schools.com/acs-doha.aspx i have toured the campus and have to say it 's quite impressive . my son is at compass , which i am quite happy with , but you wo n't go wrong with acs-doha either . here 's some info from their website : the programme initially we will be offering our prestigious early years , lower school , and middle school curriculums , based on globally recognised american and international standards , with an aim to deliver the same range of academic programmes successfully offered at our three uk campuses -LSB- learn more -RSB- . as the campus develops a high school we will also seek authorisation to offer prestigious us college board advanced placement -LRB- ap -RRB- courses . acs doha will also offer an american high school honours diploma . the school will shortly be a member of the council of international schools . the doha campus offers a rigorous academic curriculum of english , mathematics , science , humanities , world languages , and fine arts . our programme challenges students to become independent , reflective , inquiring , and knowledgeable ; confident communicators who are principled , open-minded and caring ; socially and emotionally intelligent and able to embrace the importance of a healthy and balanced lifestyle .
be careful , it is one where
be careful , it is one where spoiled rich children with bad habits and manners conglomerate . because it is so overpriced and because of its location it would attract mostly these types . remember ; your child will learn more from his peers than from his teachers . there are still many good schools where your child will much happier . take sherborne which is a very good school in the uk i hear but here in qatar it is suffering from the same problem i mentined above !
well my children are not
well my children are not spoilt , dont have bad manners , havent any bad habits you would worry about and we are not rich - neither are their friends of which they have many . for you information children learn first and foremost from their parents and taking into consideration your highly critical letter i am trying to picture your children , if you have any of course . if parents bring up their children well enough , they will not be affected so much by negative peer pressure whatever school they are in .
hello d-esertmum where are
hello d-esertmum where are your kids ? how can you be not rich and have your kids attend one of these schools ? and if the company is paying the fees then your salary must be quite high . acs doha has not started yet anyway , so do your kids go to sherborne ? hope to hear from you because i disagree that kids do n't learn much from their peers ; peer pressure is a strong force !
sorry i prefer not enter into
sorry i prefer not enter into such arguments . you are entitled to your opinion and i likewise . i am just saying my peace . i hope you are happy with where your kids are at school . i am and thats all that matters to me .
we are only trying to help
we are only trying to help someone decide on a matter that will affect the future of her children . if you say things along those lines then i think you should substantiate it . you responded to my first comment as though i did n't know what i was talking about and when i responded back , you said you did n't want to discuss the matter ! i think this is unfair ! why did you challenge my opinion in the first place ?!
help someone ? really ? bye

dog walking on the corniche ?
can anyone please help ? i adopted a pup from qaws on friday after the big fire and took him down the corniche last night with my family for a lovely walk . we could not see any signs not to walk the dog but somehow felt out of place doing it ! can someone please tell me if it is okay to walk dogs there as i do not want to offend anyone . many thanks ,
thanks for your comments so
thanks for your comments so far guys . just to let you know i always clean up after him and he does not bark at anyone . i would not trust any dog to be let off the lead ... well not over here anyway so he will always be by my side :--RRB- i enjoy a walk down the corniche and wanted my new dog to enjoy the same .
someonenew
i beg to difer . . i have seen some real dogs at the corniche . . ruffffffffffffffff !
:-RRB- brit . that 's probabaly
:-RRB- brit . that 's probabaly true but as far as i know dogs are not allowed in the corniche , parks and other public places in qatar . most people who have dogs in qatar walk them on isolated beaches and empty spaces near their houses . please ask xena/chelsea/qaws people about this . dont get into trouble by walking them at places where they are not allowed . `` ali baba and 40 thieves '' are now `` ali baba and 30 thieves '' ; 10 were laid off .
not allowed
its unfortunate but dogs are not allowed on the corniche and even other small parks in neighborhoods . its not a dog friendly country ! also be careful if you are by a beach and you let a dog off leash chances are someone in a car will get close to it and steal it happened to friends of mine .
how sad ...
... that we are not allowed to walk dogs on the corniche . what harm can that do ? another minus point for this country , to add to many others already .
i agree with you alumnar ,
i agree with you alumnar , not a lot you can do !
just pretend as if the dog
just pretend as if the dog is walking you and no one will have any problem ! i do n't think corniche is off limits to dogs , but make sure the dog is with a leash . .
lol kwan !!!
i just love the idea that the dog is walking you !!! i would love to be there if somebody walking a dog is approached and told off and uses that as a response ... i bet that will take a while to sink in ! thank you for the good laugh !
i do n't know about signs ,
i do n't know about signs , but i have seen a couple of people walking their dogs there . . just remember not to leave any doo-doo behind : -RRB-
no problem mate , just be
no problem mate , just be sure your dog is not barking or he will not bite someone . <a href="http://www.danasoft.com"> <img src="http://www.danasoft.com/sig/381129.jpg" border="0"> </a> <div style="font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:11px;"> <img src="http://i41.tinypic.com/15xppg9.jpg">
barking is instinct
since u have just adopted the pup , as jaredboy sugested of no barking/biting , teach the pup of not barking/biting in public places , avoid walking late evenings as lot of kids walking freely of all nationalities , so that some cranky parents object .
i think the corniche is off
i think the corniche is off limits to dogs . `` ali baba and 40 thieves '' are now `` ali baba and 30 thieves '' ; 10 were laid off .
not allowed !!
nothing is more relaxing than flying like an eagle in heaven !! it s not allowed . not allowed to take ur pets to the cornishe , not allowed to fish there , not allowed to swim there , not allowed to ride bicycle . and if the police catch u doin any , i think the fine is 600 qr . am sure bekoz we took the puppy with us when i was with my friend and the police stop us and ask us to take the dog away . honestly we didnt know that its not allowed and he explained to us the above mentioned .
a question !
i moved to a house in alnasr st. , but my neighbor is having a place besides my window , he uses this place for chicken , and house birds which makes a very bad smell , and dirt , is that acceptable by law ? a h m e d f a t h e y
i was just down there
i was just down there yesterday . it seems as though there are certain areas with a sign that says no dogs and other areas that do n't . i 'm not sure if this means it applies to all areas of the corniche or just the ones that explicitly say so . then again the police are the ones enforcing it and they may be ignorant as well .
do n't bother
you will be stopped eventually . it wo n't be the arabs that stop you , it is the indians that hates dogs . they seem them as dirty ; which is shocking as most indians do n't wash their hands and spit in the street .
who let the dogs
who let the dogs out ??????????????????? please tell me when you 'll be at corniche with your dog so i reschedule sincerely cynophobic yalla !

i have got a valid indian license , can i apply for the test directly
without going thro any driving school , if so wats the fees and procedure for the test . .
re : i have got a valid indian license , can i apply for ...
my friend , without basic training you can not directly go for a driving test . only us and european license holders can directly apply for a test . indian or even a m.e license is not considered for direct test . the basic course will cost you near about qr 600 / - good luck
re : i have got a valid indian license , can i apply for ...
technically , yes you can ! but i would advice you to take even a short refresher `` practice '' of the actual test so you 'll be familiar with the venue and manner of test driving !
re : i have got a valid indian license , can i apply for ...
technically yes you can have 2 atempts for a direct test but you will never be able to clear , i sugest to take short cource before you give test , it will clear you in one shot . all the best

it is illegal sharia law http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/06/03/24/10027928.html the sharia : how it affects you by bassma al jandaly , staff reporter published : november 02 , 2007 , 01:19 you could be sharing an apartment with a friend of the opposite sex . and the arrangement could be innocent , purely for financial reasons . but in the eyes of sharia law you are committing an offence . more and more people are being punished because they claim they were unaware of the law and its clauses . there are hundreds of cases such as these that emerge each year either from the police or the courts . an increasing number of men and women , who are not blood relatives nor legally married , and have shared a flat , room or even sat in tinted cars , are being jailed and deported , a lawyer said . these men and women have shared no relationship . dr adel khamis al mimari from al itazan consultant and advocates said they are being punished in accordance with sharia law . the clause is known as `` tawajed '' or `` tahseen al ma'asiya '' . these couples have been punished under this clause : sharing a closed place and encouraging sin even though they shared no relationship . he told gulf news : `` the bottom line is awareness . many foreigners are not familiar with sharia law and hence they are punished . if these couples go unnoticed , then there is no trouble . but if the authorities for some reason or another know they are sharing a ? closed space ' they can be punished . this is the law . '' all about respect `` these couples believe they are leading a normal life , like they would in their home countries . but this is considered a sin here . filipino nationals top the list of nationalities who fall into this trap followed by indians , europeans and chinese . people should be educated about this issue to avoid problems . '' dr ahmad al qubaisi , a leading islamic scholar , told gulf news that every nation has its culture and traditions . each nation should respect others . `` westerners respect each other and they know their countries ' traditions and laws . so why when it comes to muslims they claim that they do not know anything about the traditions and culture ? the west knows well that muslims , like hindus , christians and jews , have their culture and traditions . they should respect our religion , '' dr al qubaisi said . the tradition `` our tradition is against a man and woman , who are not legally related , mingling privately or being in a closed place alone , while in the west they can have a sexual relationship even though they are not married . our traditions are very different , '' dr al qubaisi said . `` we see many such cases of foreign men and women in courts . they say they do not know the traditions and religion here . they should know and respect our tradition the same way we respect their tradition and religion , '' he said . the sentence dr khalifa rashid al sha'ali , dean of the faculty of law at ajman university , said if a man and a woman who are not related are caught alone in a private place , they face a jail sentence or lashes even if they were not involved in any suspicious act . it is up to the judge 's discretion to decide whether they should be deported . dr al sha'ali , a former ajman police chief , told gulf news that during his tenure , he dealt with several such cases . mohammad yousuf , deputy director of the dubai courts department , said while the federal punitive law is implemented in the uae , the situation is different in dubai . the tawajed or tahseen al ma'asiya clause , he said , is not implemented in dubai . sultan khalifa bin bakheet al matroushi , chairman of the ajman federal appeal court , said if a man and woman are sitting alone in the work place or in front of people , they will not be charged . if they are found in a bedroom or in a house or car and the circumstances are suspicious , they will face charges even if they have not committed adultery . the couple can also be deported , he said . justice minister explains the law mohammad bin nakhira al daheri , minister of justice , told gulf news that according to sharia , if a man and woman are found in a closed place alone they may get arrested , but he gave an assurance that they are held for good reason . he stressed that the police would investigate first . `` if a couple is found alone in a closed place such as a house , room or car they may face legal action . there also must be a complaint against them . however , if their actions are not against public morals such as being in their work place or inside a lift , of course no action would be taken . if police receive a tip that a man and woman are in a closed place , they will investigate and if they are not doing anything against the law they will not be punished . `` there must be a complaint and investigation from police . the public prosecution and the judge can decide if something illegal was going on , '' al daheri said . what the people say kristina from macedonia has been living in the uae for the last six months . she said she has no idea about sharia law or the clause , which prohibits men and women , who are not blood relatives nor legally married , from sharing a flat , room or even sitting in tinted cars . `` people must have privacy . it is strange that a neighbour or a watchman can call the police if two people are in a private place alone . why do n't people call the police when they hear someone beating up his wife at home ? `` many of us here are not muslims . we respect islam and the traditions of this land . hence , our way of life should also be respected . '' she said it is the responsibility of companies who hire people from abroad to make them aware about sharia . `` this law does not exist in my country , where it is normal to be with your boyfriend alone in a closed place . i think if companies alert people before they come here , it will help them . '' mohammad elias from india is in his 20s and not married . he has been in the uae for two months , but says he has never heard about the clause . `` i may not agree with the clause , but i do respect the law of the land here , and i think foreigners should adhere to the law , '' he said . tess yema from the philippines works as a teacher in a school in sharjah and has been here since august . `` i am aware of the law . i have a brother-in-law who has been in the uae for many years . he told me about the clause . `` before coming to the uae , the authorities in my country told me about sharia . i knew these aspects very well before coming here . i respect the law in this country and i respect their way of thinking even if it is different from the one in my country , '' yema said . `` i was even told about the dress code here . i knew that if i offended the law i would face punishment , '' she said . samer assaf is married with two daughters . his family is in syria . `` i have been living here for more than 15 years , but i have never heard about this clause , not in my country and not here . i am a christian , but i respect the traditions and customs of others . '' lucia alinea from the philippines , has been in the uae for a few months only , but she is well aware of the clause . `` my brother has been here for many years and he is aware of the sharia law . `` i tried to learn as much about the customs and traditions here before leaving the philippines . we have to respect the law here or anywhere , '' said lucia , who is a teacher in a private school in sharjah .

re : female sharing rented flat with male ?
a lot of western couples live together and do n't seem to be bothered by the law , however it is playing russian roulette to try , when at any time u can be arrested . see attached story from gulf times today : kissing lands couple in trouble by nour abuzant a married couple was sentenced in absentia to a year in prison for kissing in public and conducting an illicit relationship . the muslim woman and her christian husband , both from lebanon , skipped the country before the trial concluded after being told the state did not recognise their marriage , which took place in cyprus . despite their inter-faith union not being an issue in their home country , doha authorities ruled it unlawful even though the woman was apparently given a residence visa based on the sponsorship of her husband . the couple landed in trouble after a qatari family called the police to complain they were kissing on the corniche in april . the police officer who attended the call said he found the two in an indecent position and when he confronted them , the woman screamed that they were married . the officer insisted that their marital status bore no relevance to the offence . during interrogation , the arrested man , 27 , claimed he had done nothing more than place his hand on the shoulder of his 24-year-old wife who had arrived in qatar 10 days earlier . she told the public prosecution that she did not realise that such an act was illegal in qatar . it was during their trial that the tricky subject of the pairs marriage came up for debate . the couple presented their marriage certificate to the court . however , it was ruled to be invalid in qatar . the court admitted that a residence visa had been issued based on the fact that the two were husband and wife , but the country had the right to cancel that at any time if information came to light requiring such action . the court also admitted there was no evidence of malicious intent to hide the couples differing religions and that their documents were authentic . however , the court made it clear that qatar could not accept the marriage within the constraints of its own laws . the couples lawyer said there would be no appeal lodged against the verdict as his clients had left the country after a travel ban had been lifted .
re : female sharing rented flat with male ?
what 's the confusion ? it is illegal . are you asking if people break the law ? there may be those who do , and there may be those who get away with it for a period of time . is it a good idea ? not really . you do n't want to be embroiled in a legal system with which you are not familiar .
re : female sharing rented flat with male ?
`` an increasing number of men and women , who are not blood relatives nor legally married , and have shared a flat , room or even sat in tinted cars , are being jailed and deported '' sad but true , if you do n't want to end up in jail or be deported ... better share your room or your accommodation with same sex ... we are expats , we should respect the law no matter how cruel it is

best advice - stay in lane . do not cut across .

do not enter the roandabout until there is no approaching traffic from the left . if you going straight stay in the middlelane , if your going right stay in the right and if left stay in left . .

the best would be to drive <b> in </b> round abouts and not <b> on </b> round abouts .

this should give you the definitive answer : http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/travelandtransport/highwaycode/dg_070338 just remember that we drive on the opposite side to uk though , and unless you are turning left <b> do n't </b> indicate left !!! 184 on approaching a roundabout take notice and act on all the information available to you , including traffic signs , traffic lights and lane markings which direct you into the correct lane . you should use mirrors signal manoeuvre at all stages decide as early as possible which exit you need to take give an appropriate signal -LRB- see rule 186 -RRB- . time your signals so as not to confuse other road users get into the correct lane adjust your speed and position to fit in with traffic conditions be aware of the speed and position of all the road users around you 185 when reaching the roundabout you should give priority to traffic approaching from your right , unless directed otherwise by signs , road markings or traffic lights check whether road markings allow you to enter the roundabout without giving way . if so , proceed , but still look to the right before joining watch out for all other road users already on the roundabout ; be aware they may not be signalling correctly or at all look forward before moving off to make sure traffic in front has moved off 186 signals and position . when taking the first exit to the left , unless signs or markings indicate otherwise signal left and approach in the left-hand lane keep to the left on the roundabout and continue signalling left to leave when taking an exit to the right or going full circle , unless signs or markings indicate otherwise signal right and approach in the right-hand lane keep to the right on the roundabout until you need to change lanes to exit the roundabout signal left after you have passed the exit before the one you want when taking any intermediate exit , unless signs or markings indicate otherwise select the appropriate lane on approach to the roundabout you should not normally need to signal on approach stay in this lane until you need to alter course to exit the roundabout signal left after you have passed the exit before the one you want when there are more than three lanes at the entrance to a roundabout , use the most appropriate lane on approach and through it . 187 in all cases watch out for and give plenty of room to pedestrians who may be crossing the approach and exit roads traffic crossing in front of you on the roundabout , especially vehicles intending to leave by the next exit traffic which may be straddling lanes or positioned incorrectly motorcyclists cyclists and horse riders who may stay in the left-hand lane and signal right if they intend to continue round the roundabout . allow them to do so long vehicles -LRB- including those towing trailers -RRB- . these might have to take a different course or straddle lanes either approaching or on the roundabout because of their length . watch out for their signals 188 mini-roundabouts . approach these in the same way as normal roundabouts . all vehicles must pass round the central markings except large vehicles which are physically incapable of doing so . remember , there is less space to manoeuvre and less time to signal . avoid making u-turns at mini-roundabouts . beware of others doing this . -LSB- laws rta 1988 sect 36 & tsrgd regs 10 -LRB- 1 -RRB- & 16 -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RSB- 189 at double mini-roundabouts treat each roundabout separately and give way to traffic from the right . 190 multiple roundabouts . at some complex junctions , there may be a series of mini-roundabouts at each intersection . treat each mini-roundabout separately and follow the normal rules .
re : how to drive on round-abouts ?
get out early morning and do a few practise rounds following the above lane disciplines to add a few more tips once you build on your confidence - never keep up with the car next to you on either sides - pay extra attention to land cruisers/karwas and domestic help drivers - dont react to flashing lights and constant honking , when they pass you by , show them your palm with a smile and then touch your palm to you heart , like saying pls forgive , trust me their whole face changes
re : how to drive on round-abouts ?
drive in your won wish , concentrate on all 4 side cars around you , that is the best way , mostly arabic does it .
re : how to drive on round-abouts ?
with extreme caution
re : how to drive on round-abouts ?
i enrolled in al khebra and this is what they taught me : left turning : stay on left lane . 100 meters before round about signal left and slow down . check your left for other vehicles that are already turning in the round about . if there are vehicles passing you just stop . if none then go to the inner lane of round about . make sure your signal is left . as you pass the center of straight exit , signal right . check your right mirror for cars then you can now go to left exit on the left lane or middle lane . u turning : stay on left lane . 100 meters before round about signal left and slow down . check your left for other vehicles that are already turning in the round about . if there are vehicles passing you just stop . if none then go to the inner lane of round about . make sure your signal is left . as you pass the center of left exit , signal right . check your right mirror for cars then you can now go to u turn exit on the left lane or middle lane . straight : stay on middle lane -LRB- if 3 lanes -RRB- or right lane -LRB- if 2 lanes -RRB- . as you approach the round about slow down and check the left for other vehicles that are already turning in the round about . if free then go and stay on the middle or right lane of round about . as you pass the center of right exit , signal right . check your right mirror for safety while you go in the straight exit . stay on the middle lane or right lane as you go in . right turning : stay on right lane . signal your right and as you approach the round about slow down to check for cars on your left that are already in the round about . if free then go and turn right . remember : 1 . the cars coming from the left side of the round about is the priority meaning you have to stop and give them way . 2 . always use your signals so that other cars will know where you will be exiting . 3 . not all drivers know the proper use of signals , lanes and priorities in the round about so be careful . drive defensively . i do n't have a picture to show you but i hope you understand those instructions above . just picture the round about as a + | straight exit | | left exit ----------- right exit | | | where you are coming from hope this helps .

@ hapy , i second what qatariladysaid , they 're considered middle-eastern -LRB- brown -RRB- , not white mate ... the support they enjoy is because the jews control wall street & have a significant presence in the eu financial market as well & money talks right ?! ... also a good number of non-israeli jewish people around the world support israel financially & otherwise so hopefully this answers your question ...

it can not be just money ,
it can not be just money , money might be a major factor when it comes for foreign policies of governments but we also see that european and american people esp whites are sympathetic to israeli cause . according to this wikipedia article nearly 80 % jews of israel come from european regions.http : / / en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_israel

naturally the whole world

why would you want to bring ?
you can buy as much as you like here ... only need to wait for your rp and the liquor permit from qdc . even if you do n't have those , you can always find people who can help you in procuring :-RRB- you just need to wait for the ramadan to get over though ... :-RRB- source : - a study conducted by friedunicorn - vol i -LRB- september ,1999 -RRB-
you can purchase booze at
you can purchase booze at the qdc and at designated bars . all of these close during ramadan and will not re-open until probably sept 19 or 20 . the current line here is if you want to enter most bars you have to provide your qatar id -LRB- or passport which has a copy of your rp in it -RRB- - this allows the police to `` track '' who is entering these establishments . signature line > `` you ca n't fix stupid ''

geez man , talk about scaring
geez man , talk about scaring people off !! ... no greenman you will not get deported for attempting to carry alcohol into the country as long as you do n't attempt to hide it , if you do carry , it will be noticed when they screen your bags , plead ignorance stating that because alcohol is legally available in the country , you thought it 'd be ok to bring in , the customs officer will sternly tell you that 's not the case , confiscate the bottle/s & you will be sent on your merry way ... in not out ... this has happened to a good number of people i know & not one of them was put on the next flight back or deported or anything of the sort ... however i would advise caution if it 's during ramadan that you 're coming in ...

i am getting miss cals from +224 55201665
i am getting mis cals from +224 55201665 and other numbers but when i tried to call no reply can any body tell me is it any scam call or what ? any one else facing this problem ??? what to do kindly help me ...
re : i am getting miss cals from +224 55201665
actually to day i got same miss call from same type of number . but it 's a different number like +22355686969 . but i know it 's from my country bangladesh . because that time i call my country than i understand . some time all number not coming ... and some time all number coming but before come +22 like ... so it 's not to worry ...
re : i am getting miss cals from +224 55201665
the only thing i can tell you is that someone from guinea is miss-calling you ... as far as i know there are multiple case where someone miss-calls and you call back and then your phone load is gone or you get charged a lot if you have a subscription . but as far as i know , now there are security measures in place to prevent this from happening . but that does n't mean that they do not happen anyway :-RRB- just be careful and do n't call back . send an email to qtel or vodafone and tell them about your problem . normally they should be able to help -LRB- block the phone number from calling again -RRB- . i 'm not sure but i think you can also do that from your phone ...

re : i am getting miss cals from +224 55201665
it is a scam ... i have had calls from +224 , + 239 , +370 ... best advice is that if you dont recognise the number , do n't answer the call and do n't call back or text ...
re : i am getting miss cals from +224 55201665
are you crazy to call back an unknown number ? do you know someone to call from that country code ? have you heard about sim cloning ? if they want to talk to you they will call again . it could be a trap . there are lots of mafia who are doing cloning of sim cards and using it for illegal purposes . if you call back your sim could get cloned and will be used by them for illegal activities which could lead you to great trouble . if you are getting missed calls from unknow numbers just ignore it for being safe .
re : i am getting miss cals from +224 55201665
that 's a phone call scam from american state of illinois or from the country of guinea . http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/area_codes_847_and_224 http://countrycode.org/guinea
re : i am getting miss cals from +224 55201665
i heard that when you call to those mobile numbers all your data saved in the phone can access to the other party ... its another scam method . . so dont call back them ... `` if you are important for somebody the call will come gain ... dont go behind ugly dog who does n't care about you ''
how to convince my boss for providing noc
how to convince my boss for providing noc as she doesn wants me to go ? i have completed 6 years n getting better offer now . moreover present company does n't have the work . what to do ??? please guys give me some ideas how to convince her ?
re : how to convince my boss for providing noc
hi approach the legal authorities and present this case to them . show your bank account details to prove that you dont have job and is not paid for 1 or two months etc. be submissive to your boss and its your need to get this offer . convince her on your situation and inability to continue here even if the job is on as your boss say . i do belive that once she is convince that you have no other way and will leave her , she will agree for it . her main issue may be that if you leave with noc others will also come in line for that . manoj
re : how to convince my boss for providing noc
take her out for a drink and speak your soul out to her , i am sure she is going to say a yes and remain your friend forever and never a boss
re : how to convince my boss for providing noc
mr. manoj , there ca n't b harm if i approach for legal action ... i mean they can cancel me . plz tell me how to n to whom i have to approach
re : how to convince my boss for providing noc
do what meet12345 said . . thats a best solution . . else you have to file a case , that salary is not according to your qualification and experience . . and get the release by court . . our accountant did same thing with his previous company . -LRB- 2nd option -RRB- but try your best to get release from her in proper way . . convince her . count a million problems . or else demand a big salary . and in mean while try for another country . . may be you get good chance out side qatar . . life is not only in qatar . .
re : how to convince my boss for providing noc
dear . try to be more active and strong with her as she have no reasons to keep u doing the same every month for nothing just show that you r angry and may contact the labor department . for more info u can call me any time 77513154 . most of sponsors need no issues with labor ministry so you can count on it as she ca n't pay u
re : how to convince my boss for providing noc
since you are telling your present company is not having job , so convince him to release you and provide noc
re : how to convince my boss for providing noc
its a common problem , try to handle and manage your boss . otherwise no way to get noc .
re : how to convince my boss for providing noc
it purely depends upon your relationship . buy some sweets and try to meet her after office hours if possible . as you both chickas so i guess meeting outside is not so tough . and show her you offer and discuss your future plan with her like you will get married , you have problems in your family , you need to be more financially secured to help them etc. i did the same to leave my previous employer . my boss was so impressed that he gave me noc and he gave me his own money too . of course i dont wanted money from his pocket but my story was so emotional . i guess you got the point .
early learning
hi i have 2 years old daughter ; when we can start '' early learining '' ? ; is there any book ; games which we can start with ? anybody can help ?
re : early learning
go to jarir book shop and ask for pre-nursery school material such as color blocks and numbers and alphabets would help her .
re : early learning
the question is : is it the right time or it is early
re : early learning
let she play now . .2 year means very young . . for books check with jarir book store . .
re : early learning
hi you can search online for a program called `` baby einstein '' which in short is a way to teach your child to be smarter ... very interesting
re : early learning
i agree with rasheed , ... . . baby einstein is the best cd/dvd for baby learning . also try semame street cd . i read stories that 1 child -LRB- 3 years old -RRB- can read and talk becouse of the parent every morning turn-on sesame street program , and its start from year 1 .
re : early learning
hai 2 years is too early to start formal learning . . at the same time no need to neglect learning session completely ... you can use building blocks to make her familiar with the concept of numbers ... spend quality time with the kid and thus she learns names of objects with out being burdened ... read lots of stories so that she becomes familar with books and her imagination works and books automatically become her friends when she grow up ... formal learning can wait till she is 3 ... enjoy your time with her because kids grow up fast ...
re : early learning
kids are learning all the time , talk to your child all the time . talking and reading fun books with your child will give them a good start . baby einstein videos are great you can watch some of the dvds on youtube link http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqy71epi14q&feature=related you can also view lots of learnig materials on abc 's , learning colours , nursery rythmes etc on youtube . link : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltfxyvnixws bear in mind while these videos are good for kids to watch and learn , dont replace them with reading , drawing with crayons , puzzles , blocks etc. also be invloved and play with your child , they will learn whilst they are having fun with you .

re : feedback for the wall real estate ...
i salut the wall for giving the tenants a very woderful services . i go fo the wall , its highly recommended !
re : feedback for the wall real estate ...
`` the wall '' is one the best ! i had a lot of experiences living from one flat to another and im proud to say that i made the rigth decision . from the staff down to the maintenance they were all accomodating and provide excellent custome service .
re : feedback for the wall real estate ...
if you 're looking for a flat , dont think twice because the wall provides everything you need ! i 've been with them for 3 years and now i just renewed my contract with them , the staff were decent and if you have any questions or encounter any problems with their service they will never hesitate to extend a helping hand .
re : feedback for the wall real estate ...
i recommend the wall real estate !!
re : feedback for the wall real estate ...
aside from a good rate of services level , one thing more wonderful about the wall real estate is that the people behind , the staff are very nice and friendly , they are treating us as good friends , more like a family actually . i belive it is a factor that determines the rises and the fall of a certain company . go for the wall , surely you will not regret .
re : feedback for the wall real estate ...
the wall real estate stands out among any other real estate company in doha and proud to say that they have a good reason to be . my family has been living in one of their apartments and we are really satisfied with the quality of their service . just last month , we renewed our contract with them . truly , your investment with the wall will never gone to waste . goodluck !
re : feedback for the wall real estate ...
good thing about the wall is that either major or minor problems we encountered at their apartment , they will be there quickly to fix it.once the lock of or bedroom door got broken and i figured out how to fix it because its just a minor problem and my kid is the one responsible for that , so i did what i can do and still i cant find the way -LRB- not to mention that i am not really in to it -RRB- , so i decided to give a call in their office and told them what happened , after 30 minutes , the maintenance is there to fix the lock.big thanks !!
re : feedback for the wall real estate ...
im just new in their apartment and it was never a bad experience at all .
re : feedback for the wall real estate ...
at first i was hesistant with ` the wall ' until i got the chance to speak with one of their staff . i was greateful that she provided me answers to all my questions . the wall does not only offer you good and nice flats/villa/units but at the same time they also have respectful and sincere staff .
re : feedback for the wall real estate ...

re : feedback for the wall real estate ...
one of my friend has changed flats being incomfortable with 3 real estates ... now he rented with wall realestate & is happy since last 2 years with their outstanding service .
re : feedback for the wall real estate ...
it really feels good if we voice out what we feel deep inside , it soothes all the negative energies around.just same like this forum , some say good things or the other way around regarding a certain issue . anyway , my encounter with the wall real estate is a very heart warming and worth remembering incident . it was when i was suffering from fever and the fridge in my apartment stop working , so i called the staff asking if they can fix it for me , after 2 hours they came and just after they got it back to the normal , i suffered from convulsion , what the staff did was they called the ambulance and brought me to the hospital -LRB- i am living alone , so no one can do that for me -RRB- . until now i am still with the wall.such a very wonderful staff .
re : feedback for the wall real estate ...
im glad i met the wall !!!
re : feedback for the wall real estate ...
i was apprehensive to try the wall real estate but through the testimonies of my co workers who was with the wall , i was encourage and never did i thought that it was a fantastic decision i have made . there was this one time that i had to call them because the exhaust fan of my kitchen does not work properly , guess what , before the day ends , they fixed it .
re : feedback for the wall real estate ...
the flats are spacious , clean and very homey . for sure you will like it .
re : feedback for the wall real estate ...
few years ago i bump in to the wall real estate , i was eager to know their facilities and over all maintenance of their apartments.and when i saw that all is done properly and neatly , i moved to their flat and until now , i am still with them . i am really satisified with their service .
re : feedback for the wall real estate ...
yes!really amazing real estate!if i were you , check first the flats and decide.for sure you will like it , just like us , just first glimpse of the apartment then we fell in love with the unit and plus the staff who was with us was really nice .
re : feedback for the wall real estate ...
the quality of their services is outstanding and the staff are friendly . surely , you will not regret it . i have been residing in one of their flats and it is really nice .
re : feedback for the wall real estate ...
i have just been through all the responses for this question . its seems that 90 % of the positive feedback - and it is really positive feedback has come from people who have been members of ql for no less than 1 day ! is it possible that someone from the wall has seen this question and created loads of profiles and then given loads of excellent feedback ? no real estate agency in qatar is that excellent !!
re : feedback for the wall real estate ...
well , i guess who can really testify of their services are those who has been living with the wall and i am one of them . i am greateful that finally i have found a place where i can call home . you should give them a try .
re : feedback for the wall real estate ...
i also go through all the answers and its possible that someone from the wall made all these bunch of comments , but we really dont know.maybe yes and maybe no . i am also new in ql and i guess every hour someone sign up on this site , it means that ql is growing fast . well , about the question , i can say that they are a good real estate company.my filipino friend lives in one of their flats and based on what she experienced with them , she was satisfied.i was also given the chance to meet their office staff and they are so amazing . maybe , some find it unbelievable but for those who has good experience with them , the wall is one of the best real estate here in doha . see and believe , dont just believe what you hear . have a great day !!
re : feedback for the wall real estate ...
i go for the wall !
re : feedback for the wall real estate ...
they suck and i would not rent anything from them again . we are waiting for our contract to finish so that we can see the back of them.no service , no up keep of properties , rude staff and they make you pay for everything even if it was wear and tear . good luck .
re : feedback for the wall real estate ...
they are so bad . i have been trying to move out for 2 years . the service is so bad and watch out for your deposit when you leave ! it will take so long to pay and if they do , they will keep part of it . why ! excuses and more excuses . every time i spoke to the staff , it felt like hitting your head against the wall ! ironic !! : - -LRB-
re : feedback for the wall real estate ...

where can i buy good and effective bed bug eliminator spray here ?
i am so upset about little creatures , they keep on coming back even if i keep my room clean . but my suspect was this other room which is i think a factory of bed bugs . i want to eliminate these creatures before any serious infections happen . but i do n't know where can i find the pest pesticides for this problem , please guide me ...
re : where can i buy good and effective bed bug eliminator ...
the best and it really works !! is at carrefour is called spring ' anty bladluis ' is a green can . is for gardening but was the only one to kill my bed bugs and is cheap ! and safe for beds . =-RRB- please try it . is in the gardening section
re : where can i buy good and effective bed bug eliminator ...
the best thing to kill bed bugs is actually free - uv light ! take your mattress outside for a few hours . do n't forget to turn it regularly .
re : where can i buy good and effective bed bug eliminator ...
they are the worst creatures/bugs on planet earth . its so difficult to exterminate them . what ever pesticide you will use most probably they will show up again . what ever the pesticide . the only thing i believe can work is that take all your wooden furniture out in hot sunny day including your bed and leave it there for couple of hours . killing them by burning them is the only good solution . pesticide can work but you will never get 100 % results . i once saw a documentary on national geographic and i am telling you its really hard to get rid of them . if you think they are coming from the next room then my recommendation to move out . if i have to pay 10k for one room i will instead living in a room which is free but full of bugs . good luck exterminating bugs . peace .
re : where can i buy good and effective bed bug eliminator ...
you can try carrefour saw some thing there . but like balderick2dogs suggested uv light is best will get rid of most of these bugs . .
re : where can i buy good and effective bed bug eliminator ...
hi friends , those nasty bed bugs are not only living on the bed . they live on the curtains , furnitures and even under carpet . if you leave them untouched for some time they will increase in number . uv light is good for killing them from your bed but you can not take everything to sun light . it will be better if you treat all the materials in your room at the same time . take your bed to the balcony or terrace and leave it there for two three days in the hot sun light turning it upside down very often . you may use the pesticide -LRB- the one from carrefour -RRB- in your room for one or two days . spray well and keep the room closed . you should use it vigorously . this will kill the bed bugs in your room as well as on your bed . make sure that your friends in the other room should also do it at the same time otherwise you will not be able to clear them .
re : where can i buy good and effective bed bug eliminator ...
uv light !
re : where can i buy good and effective bed bug eliminator ...
buy `` good bye bed bugs '' spry from al-meera . this is a product of `` good bye '' company . i do n't know this available in qatar , but available in uae .

well , it depends if you can show some attitude and communication skills to the immigration officer in dubai and be able to convince him that you are just enterting dubai for specific purpose then you might get a visa on arrival .
re : visa on arrival !
sure but the title of supervisor shuld be on both of passport and visa

re : is it true that you can go by car from doha to dubai ?
just drove to dubai last thursday it took me about 7.5 hours . that is stops at the borders , stopping for gas and food and an average speed or about 130 kph . also you would need to be traveling with your husband as a women traveling alone is not allowed through saudi . 1 . letter of no objection is required from your work then you submit your passports through the agency which will cost about 125 qar . keep in mind also you will need to submit the registration card copy of which car you will be taking .

just let me know the date , time and location and i can have it sent over to you . .
re : where could i rent -LRB- just -RRB- tables and chairs
hi azzy ... its a small group , and 4-5 dishes might turn out expensive . if you let me know the kind of cuisine you prefer , i may be able to help you plan ordering it . its better to order it by dishes rather than order it by catering . you can then order whatever you like . just think about it .

its not considered illegal as
its not considered illegal as long as u have a marriage certificate attested from the embassy of the respective countries . they didnt even ask us abt our religion !
better advise
i never heard any religion saying that if you love someone , and because of you are just divided by faith , loving him/her will give you one way ticket to hell . religion usually refers and teaches fairness , respect , truth , humility . so no discrimination of faith in marrying as per as i know . i have several friends married muslim to a non-muslim , either way but the teachings of goodness manifest on how they apply towards other people and work , and not towards on what they are believing religion . anyway , opinion is a really opinion ... there is no right nor wrong . and we can not further discuss if the basis is holy quoran and holy bible . we can not justify arguments from different basis . they have both their own strong points , deal with it . if the marriage documents are attested by the both consul , then i think there is no problem and big deal at all . this is just a discussion forum , do n't use this as your actual reference . the best thing is to inquire your cases to qatar government agency directly , you are not the only one who have this kind of problem anyway , i 'm very sure there is always fair ruling that you can get from them . good luck !
`` anyway , opinion is a really
`` anyway , opinion is a really opinion ... there is no right nor wrong . '' but the marriage in islam is not a matter for anyone to give an opinion over ... it 's a fixed law . it 's forbidden ... so it 's wrong . . any `` true '' muslim would n't even dare to cross that line ... but i assure you whoever did it . . they 're muslims by name . . and i do n't think they care to pray or fast ... if they fear god . . they would n't have done it ...

okay , so i guess getting a working visa for us would not be a problem since there are two different sponsors . but the fact that we would be doing something illegal concerns me . we would most definitely be living together and that should be considered illegal because of our muslim-christian marriage . and on top of that , we could not get a housing from sponsor because our marriage is considered faulty .

there be no problem in getting visa because you 'll be working w / different sponsors . you will only face problems when caught living together and/or if you change your wife 's sponsorship under you . because islamically you are not legally married and qatar is an islamic country .

troll alert
mega troll alert . bepsy gave you away ...
i do n't think your marriage
i do n't think your marriage will be considered valid here . there was a story some time back about a couple who were deported after some public display of affection issues on the cornish . when the case went to court turned out that their marriage was considered invalid and they both ended up being deported .
saeedkhan you wasted your breath on bebsy and bob corn
troll
marycatherine . .
my hubby is a convert and he had to have legal documents attesting his conversion , along with our marriage certificate , as he has n't changed his name legally . thus he has to prove he is a muslim when applying for family status . so the sponsor will find out the op 's not a muslim unless he has documents to prove he is a convert .
from different sponsors ... so

buying s volvo car
hi friends i am intending to buy a second handed volvo car of s80 ,2004 within my range but worried about the maintenance and other expenses which may rise in future that would drain out my pocket.can anyone share their experience of using the same car and also your opinions about that car of second handed type .
re : buying s volvo car
never think about it , maintinance cost is very high and the resell value is very low .
re : buying s volvo car
ask previous volvo owners . if you ask the vast majority of qatar living members that will drive nothing but japanese cars then you wo n't get an honest answer . also please do remember that you are buying a prestige brand so the cost of maintaining that will be more than a cheap , volume brand . when it comes to customer service at volvo service centres , please just try them once . they are professional , courteous and most of all honest . if you would like any information or history on the car you are buying please do not hesitate to contact me on 6022476 . i work for domasco volvo and we do value all of our customers !
re : buying s volvo car
i 've been using volvos for about 5 years now both in qatar and in the uk and they have proven to be very reliable cars . the cost of maintenance is slightly higher than most but then you are getting what you pay for . regarding the comment about cars falling apart after 5 years , i think that person was talking about american cars .
re : buying s volvo car
i agree with joe90 . the s80 a great car . here in north america both volvo and honda are considered great cars -LRB- and toyota -RRB- that offer great value and great service from dealers . it 's disappointing to hear the dealers of these cars n qatar does n't hold up their end of the bargain . you 'd hardly need to worry about a volvo breaking down . when it does , yes , parts are a bit more expensive than japanese cars but nowhere near the level of mercedes or bmw . it 's comfortable and safe , huge trunk , sporty feel . you could feel the heavy weight of the car when you first start driving it , which is why it uses as much gas as it does . i love mine but sadly have to sell it soon when i move to doha . so , that 's why relatively , i see less hondas on sale on this site than toyotas . the dealership . i was wondering why i do n't see the honda ridgeline and pilot listed anywhere , nor the toyota sienna . honda 's mystery solved .
qn for all moms - frequent fever
my kid is falling sick frequently for the past 3 months.whwnever i go to the doctor i receive the same answer `` viral fever '' and nothing to worry about . is it common for the kids here or should i get her diagnoised -LRB- take her back home -RRB- completely . btw , my kid is 3 years old .

thanks ranishkt and seema , thatz so assuring.she is `` somewhat '' okay after she left the day care . doratheexplorer . . a big thanks to you.i was really worried about her blocked nose thing.she was not getting proper sleep too for the last 3 months when i left her at the day care.and sometimes she used to bring back her water bottle full.can u imagine she was not drinking water also.i saw that twice and then removed her from that day care immdly.now she is with my maid.by god 's grace she is doing okay.still keeping my fingers crossed.there were days when i used to check her forehead continuosly for any fever -LRB- i know itz crazy but i was just going mad -RRB- . i am now becoming bolder after a lot of assurance/inputs from all.thanks to all .

hi
you go for urine routine and culture test evn doctor say no . this will help you . my son had similar problem and doctor was keep on saying ear infection , viral infection and so on . we did urine test and found uti . proper treatment was done according to the requirement .
antibiotics for a viral infection ?
i am not a heatlh care provider , but i recommend you change the doctor . if it is a viral infection , there will be no need for antibiotics . why is he/she giving her antibiotics ????????? and 3 antibiotics in 3 months ???? oh come on ! and why not a blood test ???? go to another doctor . .
get another doctor 's
get another doctor 's opinion . . just to be sure , have your child undergo a general physical as well as complete blood workup even x-ray . . no harm in doing that , this is your child 's health at stake . . <a target="_blank" href="http://www.blingcheese.com/"> <img src="http://i153.photobucket.com/albums/s235/revmyspace2/graphics/misc/smileys/smiley_25009t7y685v0e.gif" title="myspace comments" border="0"> </a> <br> < a target = '' _ blank '' href = `` http://www.blingchees

hi einstind there is no such
hi einstind there is no such a thing as viral fever , because 1 . if its viral there is no fever in the body . 2 . if there is fever it means there is infection somewhere and the natural body defense is trying to fight it by increasing the body temp . the fact she is in daycare that means exposed to many new things to her system teach her always to wash her hands . 3 years old are very smart and can remember rules :-RRB- this is what i personally do when my kid doesnt feel well : 1 . no medication -LRB- no antibiotic -RRB- 2 . keep checking the temp . every 1/2 hr . 2 . take him to my chiropractor for spinal adjustment -LRB- dr. cyrus is our chiropractor here in doha -RRB- that will help the child 's natural immunity system . 3 . chicken soup with lots of onion and garlic . 4 . no sweets or fried food . 5 . let her eat plain yogurt it helps to reduce the inner body temp . 6 . light clothes and keep washing her feet with cold water . hope this will help

i totaly agree with formatted soul
since we are here , my 3 years old daughter is always sick , she was never sick before , always having high fever , cough , her doctor used to say its an allergy he was just changing the medecins and giving her antibiotics , so i decided to take her to another doctor when t told him what happend he decided to do a chest x ray and he found out that my daughter had atypical pneumonia !!! so you have nothing to loose by doing a chest x ray ... by the way she got it from the nursery ... good luck .
also if it is a virus , they
also if it is a virus , they are not supposed to give you anything for it . you are supposed to let it run it 's course . no antibiotics . i hate it when my daughter is sick ... i feel so helpless . i hope your little one feels better soon . be strong . motherhood ... the hardest job you 'll ever love ! : -RRB-
thanks mm ...
by god 's grace she is okay now.hoping that she will not fall sick again.but this is what i am going to do the next time she falls sick.i am going to insist the doctor for an x-ray and a blood work-up . bcoz she is having blocked nose very frequently -LRB- not running nose -RRB- . i suspect there is something beyond this normal cold and fever thing .
get a humidifier or take her
get a humidifier or take her in the bathroom with you and run the shower on hot so it creates a lot of steam . that will help clear her nose . another thing i use is vicks baby vaporub . it has menthol and eucalyptus , and it opens their little noses pretty quick . i worry about the medical care standards here , but so far dr 's attiya and samer at al ahli have done a great job for my daughter and we have been here almost 2 years . good luck , hope the little one stays well ! : -RRB- motherhood ... the hardest job you 'll ever love ! : -RRB-
its better to do a chest
its better to do a chest x-ray ... ask the doctor to test for pneumonia ... the doctors here dont really diagnose it at the initial stage ... but it will be worse later . repeated fever is one of the symptoms ... <a href="http://photobucket.com/images/funny" target="_blank"> <img src="http://i244.photobucket.com/albums/gg12/n-a-t-a-s-j-a/funny/smile.gif" border="0" alt="smile pictures, images and photos"/> </a>
common anywhere/everywhere
the new name given by my family to this vi is school syndrome , you shall notice that this occurs frequently when the schools open and continues . this ss goes away or stabilizes when the schools go for longer break -LRB- fortnight or more -RRB- . the issue is that we go to the doctors when the symptoms are acquired and he works with you to remove or stable it . the area where no body works on is the prevention , both the parents and the school managements or even the health authorities . it is all left on herd immunity but does not affect much . the parent should teach the kids basic hygienic plus give them fresh clothes every day and make them take shower every time they land in and also give them the natural preventive gifts -LRB- details can be provided on direct im/pm -RRB- the school should have better distances between each pupil -LRB- seating arrangement -RRB- and better ventilation arrangement in the class and or playground -LRB- if internal -RRB- and further monitor that no kids with flue or infection should attend the classes . furthermore the transport should be much cleaner and well ventilated . the schools should also have records of the pupil who have pets at home specially the caged/feathered pets , to be sure of the possible sources should some viral infections arise from the pets , . the health authority should be the observers for both of the above actions on frequent basis . this can get really worrying if with this frequent hit of viral infection and following on use of antibiotics , the children will get immune to the ab and then one have to use steroids which is not good at all . this out of my experience should bring the so called ` school syndrome ' to the least ... hope this helps you as well . take care

there are plenty of things to buy online that are a lot cheaper than buying in qatar , here are some of the things that i have bought online : apple products - much cheaper sunglasses - raybans ; much cheaper mobile phone accessories asics gel trainers - much cheaper books - much better selection and cheaper . generally anything that i want to buy that is going to cost over qr500 , i will check online to see how much i can get it for there . i get all the stuff sent to my aramex account and then sent to me here in doha .
never had any online
never had any online purchase , but would like to get some feedback .
isobel
in amazon if you choose products which are sold and shipped by amazon you have the option of shipping them as one package , or if you get some products which is being sold by amazon but sold by some other seller then it will be shipped from two places to your aramex account . aramex unfortunately does not have the possibility to consolidate all your packages and ship as you want , hope they start it soon coz of their prices . but dhl easyshop does it . i have n't used them till now , but if i do end up buying from different places then i would definitely use it .
it depends on the items
check the prices online + tax + shipping rates then compare the items price sold in qatar . i bought dlsrs , lenses and camera accessories for me and my friends in amazon.com or adorama.com as it is much cheaper there with shipping rate and tax included
how long does qatar post delivers mail/parcel from uk royal mail ?
i purchased an item from ebay and was mailed via royal mail by the seller , and it has already left uk since november 12 . . do you guys have an idea how long qatar post deliver mail/parcels ? especilally those coming internationally . .
re : how long does qatar post delivers mail/parcel from uk ...
about 10 days normally - but you should consider using aramax 's ship and shop service next time
re : how long does qatar post delivers mail/parcel from uk ...
in qatar , it is not delivered . one has to go to post office to collect even letters . when bank sent credit cards to me via mail , i got repeated calls from post office to collect my mail from post office . at first i was very much surprised to hear that , i got mail . it is in post office and i was asked to come during post office working hours to collect it ? then why it is called postal service ? wait for phone call from post office after eid holidays .
re : how long does qatar post delivers mail/parcel from uk ...

mobile phones , internet and television
hi there i am moving with my wife and son to doha in january 2013 . i would like to ask anyone who knows , how quick or difficult it is to get up and running with mobile phones and also if i speak to our landlords about getting the internet at our new home or is this done by ourselves ? and what do i need to set up for tv channels in doha ? any advise would be greatly appreciated .
bring an unlocked phone -LRB- that
bring an unlocked phone -LRB- that uses a normal sim card -RRB- with you . you can get a pre-paid -LRB- pay as you go -RRB- hala -LRB- service name -RRB- sim from qtel in the arrivals terminal after customs on production of your passport . once you get your rp , you can keep the number and change to shawry -LRB- service name , 30day rolling contract -RRB- . with regard to qtel landline and internet , you can get a pre-paid dongle initially , then again once you have a rp you can get qtel landline and broadband connected . dont hold your breath regarding how quick they do it though , we 've been here for a couple of months , had my rp for 6 weeks and still havent got broadband . you will have to get permission from your landlord , but this shouldnt be a problem . hope this helps

only if you are qatari or
only if you are qatari or very wealthy . otherwise expats can not own anything . my family and i have been here all our lives , in fact my grandfather has been here as long as the country was first discovered . not allowed to be citizen even if born and raised here . sad truth . qatarization
if you buy a property you
if you buy a property you will get a residence permit to live here but you can not work with that visa .
/ - a-t - / pq : this information
@ pq : this information is not correct , as far as my information is concerned . the real estate agents will give you a paper then you are at your own to get the rp from moi . i have not seen any law that allows expats to get the rp based on their property . this initiative was taken by dubai and ended as well in 2008 .
any first hand experience
any first hand experience here ? rp based on property ?
ther you go ... discussion over !! : d
non-qataris may invest and own land , buildings and constructions in three designated projects : pearl qatar west bay lagoon al khor resort project non-qataris may also acquire rights over : real estate leased for a term of 99 years , renewable on similar terms . residential units for a term not exceeding 99 years , and in general a right to convey property belonging to another person for its own profit , utility or advantage . the law further enhances the desirability of investing in qatari property by allowing non-qatari owners to apply for visas and residency for themselves and their families without any local sponsorship . source : hukoomi
i did it
hello kombizz and everyone , i am egyptian and i bought a 2 bedroom apartment but in the pearl qatar . i have got the loan from the bank and it wa smy very good choice to do so as prices started to raise again for rents and for purchaes . although i felt at the begning that it was risky but now i am coformtable as i am paying the monthly instalment which is less than the rental offcourse for similar size and quality flat . to answer your question , yes there areas where you can buy apartments and it can give a 99 years rp , regardless of your nationality . secondly , i advise anyone who has the downpayment , to go for purchase not rental specially if he is looking for quality life . . you can contact me for further advice
if you already have a work
if you already have a work visa you wont get another rp . my uncle in us owns a property in the pearl and he got a rp here , but he can not work with that rp . you wont get it automatically you need to summit all related documents and apply for it . real estate agents help you through the process .
u can not buy a property , u can
u can not buy a property , u can just lease one
sir . fin . waves , i heard that
sir . fin . waves , i heard that expats could buy property and get rp for 99 years . not sure if its true but thats what i heard .
at the pearl
i think there was talk that expats could purchase at the pearl and then would get a long term rp . i 'm not sure anything ever came of that tho .
sir.fin.unfortunately its
sir.fin.unfortunately its sad you live this country for so long and you dont know the facts about this place . expats can buy property is designated areas i.e not only in the pearl . its true the cost of an apartment in the pearl is more than 1m . but you dont necessarily be a millionaire to own one ; banks do give mortgage if you are having a long term contract with very high salary .
what is a yanni ?
what is a yanni ?
only can buy on the pearl and
only can buy on the pearl and zig zag tower !
you can buy property here .
you can buy property here . even in muntaza area , some time back , al asmakh was selling flats . anyways , you might own the property but you will not get any residence permit against that property . this means , if/when you job is finished from here , you will not able to enter in the country based on your property here . i hope your passport is entitled for on arrival visit visa but things can go bad any time . as canada 's case ! all the best .

if your debt is with x-employer , no issues . if it 's with a bank and if you have good intention of clearing it upon getting a new/better employment - also no problem . -LRB- banks investigations will ultimately reveal your presence in your current location and details ; they can easily trace and chase you for settlement . be honest and avoid potential risks -RRB-

it 's a normal process as far as i 'm concerned . unless u 've got something to hide ? just be frank , maybe some of us can help ... good luck

ok , let me be frank . i 'm banned in abu dhabi . the question here is , can i work in doha . i 'm aware that qatar is part of gcc like uae . please help me if you know anything about this .
re : cid fingerprint and screening .
nothing to worry . . its just a normal procedure for employment visa application . your ban in abu dhabi is jut for uae only , so you dont have to worry about it here .
re : cid fingerprint and screening .
you mean there is no information sharing within the gcc country ? if so , can qatar deport me ? appreciate if there are more view on this .
re : cid fingerprint and screening .
for now . they 're working on a unified gcc database .
re : cid fingerprint and screening .
so will i have a problem once they unified gcc database ?

absolutely naothing to wory about . . unless u have done bad things in uae , . my advice is follow ur employers instruction , and stop worrying .

problem
i am working for a company since december 2008 ... can i change my job and my sponsor ? and if he canceled my visa can i go out side qatar and come back to another company ?
re : problem
salam if you want change ur sponcer the only thing you can do is just canceld ur visa and be sure it 's cancled then go out and come back business visa you can do that only one year after that you can come to new visa
re : problem
first you need a noc letter , no matter what ! second , even though you worked less than 1 year with the same company it should n't be a problem to transfer the sponsorship from one company to another , ecpesially if your new company is strong enough . your nationality is the advantage in this case .
re : problem
if cancelled , a minimum of 2 year banned will be imposed to you , banning you to come back to doha . avoid cancelling your visa and try to convince your sponsor and have a nice conversation to them . be patient and humble always .
re : problem
mr ammar . . guys do n't mislead the person , if you do n't kow what you are talking about . he can not just cancel an rp and come back under the business visa ... he wo n't be allowing into the country with noc letter in the first place ! all he needs is noc letter .
toyota fortuner 2012 . bad or good solid car ?
i am thinking of buying a toyota fortuner 2012 . is it a bad car because it has not been assembled in japan and instead it is assembelled in indonesea ? is it a solid car like all other toyota cars ? if any one has any experience with this car please let me know of your opinion ?
re : toyota fortuner 2012 . bad or good solid car ?
all car manufacturer are selling good car . its depend on your need and your budget . last week my friend buy 2012 toyota furtuner , and i drive it from industrial to his accommodation . toyota are good and high resale value .
re : toyota fortuner 2012 . bad or good solid car ?
base on my observation and according to my friends yes it was indeed an excellent 4x4 suv car . toyota has a good reputation , has a high resale value and after sale service is guaranteed superb . i have 2008 model and so far until now it has a good condition inside/outisde and never i had heavy mechanical problem so far . thanks to god ... it also depend how u used ur car and it a must to bring it to the service center every 5000 km for a service maitenance . therefore i can highly recommend it to u. : -RRB-
re : toyota fortuner 2012 . bad or good solid car ?
i would never go for a fortuner ... ! anyways , toyota always has a good resale . it dosent very much affect where the car is assembled coz they are always made with company brand 's standardization & certification .
re : toyota fortuner 2012 . bad or good solid car ?
toyota cars are solid and the resale value is good . go for it .

if yours is a personal loan ...

re : do i need to take medical exam before entering doha ?
you dont need a medical for a one week visit . a medical is required if you are going to apply for residence or a long term visit visa . then you need a medical and it must be done here in doha
re : do i need to take medical exam before entering doha ?
medical tests are mandatorily required for people coming here to stay for 6 months and more . these are basic tests only . you can go for a complete health check-up if something about your health bothers you .
re : do i need to take medical exam before entering doha ?
there is no need for a medical before entering doha for a visit . .

are creepy crawlies everywhere ?
hi we are southafrican living in uk and soon to be moving to qatar . my hubby got offered a teaching job with villa accomodation provided . problem is i am completely irked out by creepy crawlies . i read on the forum about the roaches and other pests in qatar accomodation . can anyone tell me if this problem is common in all accomodations , even more expensive ones and apartments ?
thanks that is slightly more
thanks that is slightly more comforting . i was horried to read about people having to lockdown toilet seats and gaps in the windows etc to keep them out so i wasnt sure if this is the general trend and something we should prepare ourselves for.i can imagine myself losing sleep over roaches running on my bed or getting stuck in my hair eeekk ! i understand it is a warm country and a certain amount of tolerance required , not so sure i can accomodate pests in the home though . will have to wait and see .
if you have a villa such
if you have a villa such problems would be minimal to nil in my experience . in apartments , often the case is no matter how clean you are - your neighbours standards may not be up to yours and the bugs get in . again , not as if you were living like an unhygenic family , but the bugs know no boundaries .
agree with marycatherine
mel1 as a saffer myself , i can guarantee you will see no more cockroaches crawling around your house here , than you would see back home :--RRB- qatar is parktown prawn free ; - p
well ...
i am at the company apartment at the mo ... i find i have to wash the floors everyday ... because of the cockroaches ... my house is very clean but unfortunately its the maintenance of the building which is utter crap ... and then some neighbours also certain not clean ... i have been told its pretty normal . . though the cleaner you are the better off course ... i cant wait to move to the villa as i will have a bit more control ... dont despair ... though ... i hateeeeee them so muchhhhh its the worse freaking insect i can put with ... in the uk we had the spiders but heck i managed to get rid of the things here just seems doesnt matter what i do ... you see them every now and then coming from the outside ... ewwwww ... its getting rarer and rarer but it doesnt make it any easier that we have construction site all around us ... you will be fine ... :-RRB- dont worry ... its worth leaving london to come here ... we are portuguese and southafrican who also lived in the uk for many years :-RRB- good luck and enjoy the move : -RRB-
just bring 10 big lizards
just bring 10 big lizards from uk then if you got a three rooms villa just put each room with two lizards and 1 in the kitchen , 1 in the sala and in the bathroom ...
mel1 ! a warm welcome to
mel1 ! a warm welcome to qatar . to be 100 % sure you do n't confront these stupid bugs , i suggest you to ensure that your villa is newly constructed , ie you are going to be the first occupant . also ensure that it has been furnished with new furnitures and not the refurbished or that are shifted from somewhere where it was in use . if the furniture is new , the chances of bed bugs welcoming you will be minimal . during your tenure here , keep your kitchen oil free -LRB- difficult ! -RRB- and maintain overall hygiene and you will be well off . all in all qatar is a small and beautiful country . just make sure you do n't introduce few new species in qatar . : -RRB-
i hate ccs they scare -LSB- mod
i hate ccs they scare shits outta me
hello ! well pests do exist
hello ! well pests do exist everywhere and qatar is no exception.the general standard of cleaniness is fairly good here and surely wont dissapoint.if you are goig to live in a compound then will be maintainance and cleaning as well.so no worries there .

some advice pls
what do you think is the best way to do not to feel homesick when i come to qatar ? pls give some helpful advice ... thanks !
coming back to homesickness
coming back to homesickness marlhouie , get drunk and drive it away ;-RRB- **** aal izz well ****
no , do n't drink and drive
no , do n't drink and drive unless you 're one of ` those ' .
yeah , i saw it with my own
yeah , i saw it with my own eyes !
kabayan , if you 're the one that will be assigned in dukhan ... .
yes , i would agree that if you do n't have your family here , homesickness will really struck you . now if there is a possibility that you can bring your family , better . if not , try to indulge yourself to recreation inside the community , a lot in dukhan . and i will introduce you to some of my friends who are residents there so you wo n't get bored . having a lot of friends will drive your homesickness away ! when you arrived here , let 's talk , i work there but does not live there . `` i 'm back , simple as that ''
so 100 % agreement from the
so 100 % agreement from the first two . nothing to do then except get drunk and by the time you wake up you 'll home sickness will be gone ... why not try and embrace the culture ? buy a white land cruiser , get 10 maids , drinks lots of coffee and be late for work and leave early . it 's easy yanni !

what are the activities at dukhan ?
hi marlhouie ...
actually its my 1st time to work abroad & be away with my family all the while i thought i will be very lonely here but fortunately , the company ive been working with employed many filipinos too & befriend them ... just be strong & think that the reason y we are here is for our family ... with the help of internet connection i can talked to my families whenever i want too ... so i would suggest that u keep ur connection with ur family thru chatting & have some friends here :-RRB- so be strong friend !!! think positive : -RRB-
spend your free time with
spend your free time with good friends that will keep you company and at the same time help you forget feeling `` homesick '' we left back home . . i do believe this is really important for us to go on each day without them and try to have fun as much as we want to ...

can i sponsor 23 year old son for 6 months ?
my son just finished college and would like to come to doha for 6 months and try and get some work experience . can we sponsor him ? we are uk citizens and our income is sufficient . can we do this and where do i go to get the form . i look forward to your feedback .
definitely . ask your company 's mandoob
for the form or go to immigration in gharaffa and there are people there who will type/prepare document for a very small fee . initially they will give you a family visit visa good for one month and if you really want to extend for another five months , then he has to go for medial clearance within seven days upon arrival . but still , approval of extension still depends upon the mood of the people in the immigration at the time of application ! good luck !
???
yes u can , `` family visa '' go direct in moi fill a form and they will give u 3 months visa and you can extend upto 3 months ...
will good luck , unless they
will good luck , unless they change the law without me knowing anything about it ... you ca n't sponser a son for six months family visa if he is over the age of 20 ... you can have him on a visit visa . goodluck
as far as i was aware you
as far as i was aware you ca n't sponsor males over a certain age on a family visa . i believed the age was 18 , but you could get special permission up to the age of 21 . explain the situation to immigration - maybe they can give you an alternative way to get him here . possibly an extended visit visa .
my son
was 19 and i was told that he could not be sponsored by me .
poor guy is asking about the
poor guy is asking about the visit visa what has family visa got to do with the topic do n't confuse him and pls stick to the topic avoid misguiding/confusion
stanley , i never heard of a 3-months visa ?
maybe what you mean is validity of entry period ?
shanawazt
the question was : can i sponsor 23 yr old son for 6 months ? i was told that i could not sponsor my 19 yr old son for 6 months . yaksbunt , sorry if that is confusing .
shanawatz , precisely the op is asking
for family visit visa . you are the one confused . she was asking for her son -LRB- son is part of family -RRB- , so if you can not contribute something positive , just keep quiet !
i believe that after a boy is
i believe that after a boy is 18 there is rule that the father can not sponsor him on a permanent visa but can get a visit visa . and those who are still under their dads sponsor before turning 18 have to trf to a company or prove that they are still students to continue to have this status ... i have no idea if this applies to all nationalities but i had this problem with my 20yr old ...
tinker , my son came here when he was
17 and came back for a second visit when he turned 19 . but again , it all depends on the approving party . there is no harm in accomplishing an application and submitting it . you only pay when it is approved . if it is rejected , you wo n't pay anything !
hehehehe flor
3 months `` family visa '' come on guys try to check from ur hr maybe they can give advice ...
heheheh flor
for every rules there an exemption ... just give valid reason coz my untie have diabetes and they used that as a reason ... got it ...
ok i take back what i said
ok i take back what i said you are not looking for a rp for your son you are only looking for a six months family visit ... you can get the six months and you can get a nother two so is that the total of eight months ... when you go to the immigration office outside you can ask the typers for the form to be typed for you it would cost you three qr and you take it inside door four and they will take your paper and ask you back in one to two weeks.what is you going to need are a noc paper from your sponcer a letter for a salary and a copy of your passport
i guess it varies on a case
i guess it varies on a case to case basis ... yeah flor like u said no harm in trying ...

hi carol , it appears from
hi carol , it appears from your post that you have not been to a govt hospital , then it 's a bit presumptuous to state that govt hospitals are unreliable . it all depends upon the kind of treatment your looking for . there is a pediatrician in al shefa poly clinic in hilal area , who is good . i have also visited the doctor in medcare centre , in hilal , but was not quite satisfied . take care .
pedi ...
forget about al ahli hospital !!! they charge qr500 only for consultation and the doctors are useless !!! i live here 7years and have 3 kids raised in qatar , and i promise you , al ahli is not the way to go . there is a good doctor , a female right behind the aramex office close to decoration rb . i think its family medical centre . then there is future medical centre opposite villagio , i went there twice with my youngest , was ok , not super keen with their treatment . it depends why you need to see a doctor . if your child just have a normal cold , al saad medical centre is great ! i dont have good experiance with any other gov. clinic , but can take my hat off for the al saad branch ! i know by experience and have many friends that will sware by them . if your child just have a regular cough , due to the change in weather its likely due to an alergiec reaction to the dust in the air , they will prescribe you with antihestamine = zyrtec and then a very good and herbal cough syrup = prospan , these two are all you need every time you kid passed through a viral flu . welcome and good luck . hope my info help .
yup charlepunt , go to a
yup charlepunt , go to a private clinic or to a health centre , if it 's a viral infection or the seasonal flu , they will give you paracetamol , prospan , anti histamine and if the infection has been there for some time , then they will add a antibiotic to it . so it all depends upon what kind of treatment you are seeking . by al sadd medical centre , are you referring to the ped emergency centre ?

rial to philippine peso ?
kabayan ! where can i sell my qatar rials here in the philippines ? bdo and sm do not not accept qatar rials only saudi rials .
re : rial to philippine peso ?

re : rial to philippine peso ?

re : rial to philippine peso ?
money changers near new farmer 's plaza , cubao , qc is the place and at the back of jollibee in guadalupe . good luck !!
re : rial to philippine peso ?
there are quite a few currencies that the banks will not exchange at the moment . no doubt the number will increase as those countries economies move from inflation to deflation and then full blown depression . with the crisis in gaza the region is quite nervous add to that the global economic crisis , the banks are not in a panic but they are being ultra cautious . also , the slow internet issue has sparked off a lot of conspiracy theories . but the coincidence of banks being careful , stopping currency exchange , the military build up 1,500 klms away from here , and communications being a problem is worth considering . not all banks have reacted yet but my sources indicate : - currency buy / sell bangladesh taka 0.000000 algerian dinar 0.000000 egyptian pound 0.000000 jordanian dinar 0.000000 lebanese lira 0.000000 srilankan rupee 0.000000 nepalese rupee 0.000000 philippine peso 0.000000 pakistan rupee 0.000000 syrian lira 0.000000 yemeni riyal 0.000000
re : rial to philippine peso ?
sm-malls and banks in the philippines are not buying qatari riyals ... i tried it myself , they only accept saudi riyals . you can sell it at any money changers , just be careful ! have your `` common sense '' functions properly . . before , during and after selling . get my point ?

re : can anyone tell me the normal internet connection ...
dont get 2 mb speed . max you should consider is 1mb but for most purposes 512k is fine . problem is connection to other continents is never fast so no use to get highest speed . when i test connection to north america it is never better than 375kb . mozaic is not available in all areas . i ordered mozaic dec 9 , i asked on dec 31 where installation guys were . was told by qtel that my area would not get it for a `` few '' months . nice of them to let me know ! not ! get landline , 512k or 1mb internet and then orbit satellite tv . when vodafone is in their internet may be better .
re : can anyone tell me the normal internet connection ...
512 kbps is a good speed for home aplication . . as said above . . the 512kbps internet connection will cost you qr200 per month and then the landline will cost you 33 qr per month ... altoghether 233qr per month ... there was an offer from q tel for moziac tv ... how ever it is not available in some areas in qatar as of today ...

brother and sisters living together
does anyone know if a brother and sister can live together legally . my sister is thinking of coming out here to live , she has the same surname as me as she never married . if it is ok to live together , what are the checks that are carried out ? thanks
re : brother and sisters living together
just a proof of you and your sister being siblings will do -LRB- birth certificate , passport -RRB- .
re : brother and sisters living together
if she is entering the country on your sponsorship , ofcourse once you get ok from the ministry that means you are qualified sponsor as brother and it is ok even to have a same appartment . if she is entering and working in this country on her own -LRB- visa from different sponsor -RRB- then you guys just need to keep the necessary proofs handy if and when required ... that is out of my best knowledge . all the best
re : brother and sisters living together
no issues as far as both of the passports show common parents and similar surnames
re : brother and sisters living together
when applying for ur sister 's visa , the only proof would be a copy of ur passport as well as ur sisters ' . cos , of the surename , home address and parents names , they can confirm the relationship b/w u guys . and der aitn any problem with housing ur sister here in qatar .

you ca n't stop it but you can reduce it by take bath in cold water . formula is -LRB- 2 mug cold water + 1 mug normal water -RRB- = standard water for shower , you can change the ratio as per your choice , i am sure you will get result . also save your head by wearing cap when you are outside in the day time
re : how to safe the hair falling in qatar ?
you can try looking for a shampoo with hair fall control and use normal temp water when bathing .

not coming back
can anyone help . will i need to book a return flight even though i plan on not coming back to qatar - i.e. will i get stopped at qatar airport even though i 'll have an exit visa if i have a one way ticket ? thanks
umm
and how will they know you have a one way ticket at the airport ?
besides
it is none of their business at the check-in counters to know if you have a return ticket or not , or if you 're coming back or not , it 's entirely your prerogative . if you need an excuse , `` i am undecided on my date of return , so i will book it online when i feel it 's time to come back '' ; - -RRB-
your already have exit visa
your already have exit visa dear ... so no worries ... they dont care if u will come back or not ... what important is u have a plane ticket going home ...
pierre
no - the check in staff will not bother about if you have any outstanding dues -LRB- not saying that you have -RRB- . and the immigration officers wo n't give a damn about if you do n't have a return ticket , they only stop you if you 're on repatriation and have outstanding dues .
all you need is the exit
all you need is the exit visas and your tickets to leave ! many companies issue tickets for the workers to come back while they are on holiday - it is a common practice and we have done it many times . how easy it is for some people to jump to conclusions that you are running away from debts - just ignore those comments and good luck for your next adventure , wherever it may be : -RRB-
if you have no plans tu
if you have no plans to return , why not simply resign and do the right thing by the company ? doing a runner simply screws up the visa entitlements for someone else who might enjoy it here .
baldrick , although i agree
baldrick , although i agree with you , maybe pierre 's company does not want him to leave ?
who 's coming your way to get
who 's coming your way to get one-way air ticket , further its upto you come back of not ! if company is paying u with return ticket . fly home & no need to come back !
b2d - most ` bosses ' are not
b2d - most ` bosses ' are not like you and you know that . your word ` voluntarily ' shows your respect for your workers -LRB- which is to be praised -RRB- . the op seems to have more serious issues to be able to break free from his sponsor - and with children he needs to make sure to get back to the uk for the new school term , spend christmas at home and and and ... things which are very important to people like him and many others . sometimes people just snap when the family is not happy - and even 1 week can be like hell if you do n't want to be where you are .
even u can try by booking the
even u can try by booking the return ticket nd u can cancel the same from ur home country
all my collegues have only
one-way ticket when going for vacation and our company do the booking of the return trip upon request . so the one-way ticket is not an issue . it 's the exit permit that is very important !

the immigration will not ask for your return tickets ... unless you have a cancelled visa and they are prompted by the banks that you have loans and obligations

i 'm using al manhal and the water sodium is medium , and the taste is not bad . once a week delivery though unless you call -LRB- they will delivery 1-2 more depending on how low your family is -RRB- . their prices are the same as taking an empty container to the market and dragging a full one back , but delivered to your door ! my roommate also uses wataniya , which for the first month is super service , multiple times a week . then seems to not be so super . but that could be that they changed to one to two times a week delivery and my roommate never knew -LRB- he also puts them out too late when most of the service starts 6-8am -RRB- . the differences between the two is al manhal sometimes delivers leaking overused bottles , and wataniya 's bottles almost 100 % look brand new . wataniya 's taste is n't quite as good as al manhal 's but still not bad at all .

spare the rod and spoil the child ?
who agrees that modern education system spoils the creativity of students ?
yep mm
somehow the thought of hitting , even lightly , another 's child is just wrong . for teachers there are many better ways to discipline a child than resorting to the kinda corporal punishment our teachers used . now that was quite brutal and far from bettering us it certainly encouraged naughty kids like i was to be more naughtier as a form of revenge and defiance .

modern education spoils
modern education spoils creativity ??? i seem to be living in another world altogether !!!! agree with both mimi and fatimah . whilst im against harsh disciplining a smack once in a while when the situation demands it is ok . then again when your kid becomes a teen then begin the ` tyrannical ' years ! they will say i hate u atleast once a day cuz we dont allow them to be ` like their friends ' or ' their moms allow them ' ... :-RRB- at the end of the day depends on your rapport with your child .

i think parents should smack
i think parents should smack their children whenever wherever , we 're meant to be together . . errrr ... sorry lost the track jokes apart . . i do n't see anything wrong with parents smacking their kids `` occasionally '' and when necessary . . but again do not punish your children in front of others because that would make them feel humiliated and ultimately go rebellious.i have seen many arab -LRB- parents -RRB- smacking their children in public like malls and parks etc. which in my opinion is totally wrong . . otherwise , all is good . . i got punished a lot as a kid . . but look at me now . . all the girls love me . . i can still take some smacking from my father . . : p

i think whacking the children
i think whacking the children stiffles the creativity and makes them scared to think of new ideas . however i think if used sparingly and with the other righ ingredients -LRB- coaching , love ... -RRB- , it can be helpful .
i was talking about parents
i was talking about parents smacking their kids . . teachers on the other hand are a big no no . on that note . . when i was smacked for something i did wrong i always found other creative ways to do more naughty things so that should answer your question . : p
modern education system
modern education system spoils the creativity of children ? where did you get that from ?
agree with you fatimah , the
agree with you fatimah , the occasional smack , on the right occasion , can work . but totally against teachers smacking kids . smacking is a serious punishment and should n't be given out lightly , and it needs to come from a loving parent .
agree with tdkr and
agree with tdkr and tinkerbell10 ... `` modern education spoils creativity ??? i seem to be living in another world altogether !!!! or where did you hear that ? '' . ... :-RRB- as for smacking , i dont think either at school or at home it is required unless the parents give up on children for any reason . as i understood , as i grew , time & patience was the key with parents . and so never got smacked either at home or at school . there were tough sessions specially with parents but they were patient enough to tell me or my brother and sister their pov listening to our pov , without the mindset that they being eldest are only right and at times these sessions would run for days without any hostility or bad feeling .

@brit yes i read about that yesterday . did n't know it was allowed in us to ` paddle ' the student if they do something wrong and they agreed to be paddled or whatever . i agree with the bit of ` smacking ' tho but not to the extent that your kid will just remember that you smacked him/her and not the reason why you did it . : -LRB-

please dont ask such vulgar questions on this site as its been viewed by families as well . when you know that this is a muslim country and things like this are banned here then how can you ask such a question where people sell these nonsence things ... when its ban by law then no1 has the authority or right to sell this bullshit things here.so please dont bring such stupid things on the website by supporting a fake reason .

your best bet would be online ... but you may have difficulty getting to the websites that do offer this stuff . > myviews08 , this is a real question for someone looking for real answers ! yes this is a family friendly site but that means parents need to moniter what their children are looking at on here as well as the rest of the internet . your view of this question are not helpful or required , why did you feel you needed to chime in with your views or even open this question .

adding to `` bink187 '' in addition , nothing is against islam . . i 'm a muslim and i did n't see any part in our holy quraan that says adult toys is haram -LRB- forbidden -RRB- in fact , god has permitted to the husband and wife to enjoy each other to the maximum . if you have any proof that it 's haram , please enlighten me . . otherwise , do n't be such a punk following others cuz they say it 's haram . .

saw landcruiser at busy
saw landcruiser at busy intersection on al waab yesterday with father driving with toddler on his lap and a zillion other kids jumping around all over the place inside . yes , i know it 's nothing new , but it really is time the police enforced the law concerning this . that kid would just have been mince if he 'd had an accident . makes me want to cry .
new rules :
in a major move to curb the growing number of accidents and incidents of reckless driving on qatars roads , the government yesterday promulgated a new traffic law , stipulating severe penalties for violators including a point system which would ultimately lead to the cancellation of a habitual offenders driving license . decree no 19 of 2007 , issued by hh the deputy emir and heir apparent sheikh tamim bin hamad al-thani , stated that a driving license may be suspended for three months when the total violations reached 14 points for the first time . if the same person gathered 12 points again , his license would be suspended for six months , nine months on the accumulation of the next 10 points and one year for the next eight points . ultimately , a driving license may be cancelled if the same offender earned six points for the fifth time . the penalty for using mobile phones while driving has been enhanced . the violator will have to pay a minimum fine of qr 3,000 and a maximum fine of qr 10,000 . he is also liable for imprisonment for up to one year . motorists who commit violations such as driving with no authorized license , driving under the influence of liquor , driving in the opposite direction of traffic flow , escaping from the accident site , causing sound and air pollution and exceeding the speed limit would be punishable by imprisonment from one month to three years or fined qr10 ,000 to 50,000 or both . according to the new law , the punishment for the following offences are also the same as mentioned above : not wearing seat belts , allowing children below 10 years sit in the front passenger seat , not giving way to official motorcades and the vehicles of the police , civil defense and ambulances , not leaving enough space between two vehicles and motorcyclists allowing another passenger sit behind them -LRB- pillion riding -RRB- . the law stipulates that the driver and the front seat passenger should wear seat belts all the time . cyclists should keep to the right side of the road and should ride in one line . motorcyclists are not allowed to ride on one wheel . both should wear helmets . violation points system violators of traffic rules will be given negative points as follows : jumping the red light 7 driving in the opposite direction 6 driving under the influence of alcohol 6 exceeding the maximum speed 4 driving recklessly and dangerously 4 driving with defective brakes 4 driving with inappropriate license 3 driving with stripped or invalid license 3 violating norms of public morality 3 driving an unregistered vehicle 3 driving a vehicle without number plates 3 unauthorized changes made to number plates 3 providing wrong information to pass the technical inspection 3 using the vehicle for the wrong purpose 3 blocking the flow of traffic intentionally 3 driving a vehicle without a proper silencer 3 driving a polluting vehicle 3 driving a vehicle that leaks any material that can damage the road 3 driving a vehicle which drops loads which can endanger the public safety 3 driving on the embankment 3 making a wrong u-turn 3 changing a vital part of the vehicle without a written permission from the authorities 3 giving the license to someone who has no license 2 driving a vehicle with unclear number plates 2 driving with only one number plate , or changing their shape or detail 1 refraining from giving driving license to traffic police 1 trucks violating the load conditions 1 trucks violating the width , length , or weight regulations of the vehicle 1 driving a technically unsafe vehicle 1 using lights , horns , microphones , or other machines against the law 1 disobeying traffic signs 1 -LSB- img_assist | nid = 417 | title = leo dude | desc = happiness comes only once dont miss it | link = none | align = left | width = | height = 0 -RSB-
have to say this one covers
have to say this one covers pretty much anything `` violating norms of public morality 3 '' it will only be an issue for non locals anyway . `` the penalty for using mobile phones while driving has been enhanced . the violator will have to pay a minimum fine of qr 3,000 and a maximum fine of qr 10,000 . he is also liable for imprisonment for up to one year '' the above is a joke.i have seen 4 police officers either calling or texting when driving . so to sum up , waste of time . the worst drivers will not get penalised .

re : how long it takes to learn arabic ?
how long is a piece of string . it 's taken me 17 years so far for very little result . it depends on your ability , capability and willingness .
re : how long it takes to learn arabic ?
it depends on your aims . for understanding the whole grammar and be able to talk in the streets and for a basic understanding of what you 've read you will need a whole year with 2 - 3 hours daily along with a lot of exercises at home . if you are a beginner i would suggest that you join the arabic classes in fanar building close to corniche . they have four levels . these levels will be enough for you as a beginner .
re : how long it takes to learn arabic ?
there are many private institutes offering arabic courses . if you are in govt/semi-govt entity you can join the language institute . learning a language depends on your interest , effort and capability .

re : how long it takes to learn arabic ?
fanar teaches written arabic . after 5 levels and many months you will have a vocabulary of about 300 words , not enough to speak . you will need to choose a dialect and focus on the spoken language . i did an immersion course - 10 hours a day , six days a week for 8 weeks and i am conversational .
positive discrimination
recently i went to pay a 500qr traffic violation and was astounded when i joked about a discount , they told me ok 50qr , so i gave them 450qr , they said no pay only 50qr ! omg you can imagine how amazed i was . on the way out , a sudanese clerk told me that it was usual for white expats to get this kind of service . any other expats , in particular white have experienced this too ?

hi all ql members hope u will help me i really dont know how to resize the picutre to upload as i want to post an add with the picturs but the pictures which i have are having high capacity . need ur help and advise thanx
re : how to resize the picture to upload
let us know first : what operating system you are using ? what software you are using to look and work at pictures ? any other software that you have installed to look or work at pictures ?
re : how to resize the picture to upload
just open the image in any image editing software even in paint , click resize and enter the desired resolution or size you want .
re : how to resize the picture to upload
simple steps : 1 . right click on picture 2 . click on `` open with '' 3 . click on `` paint '' 4 . after opening in paint , click on left top `` file '' 5 . click on `` save as '' 6 . give a file name and location & `` save '' it will substantially reduce the size of the picture without changing the resolution or dimensions !!
re : how to resize the picture to upload
`` right click '' the picture , then select `` open with '' microsoft office picture manager , then after opening go to the menu `` picture '' then select `` resize '' , and on the resize option select `` prededined width x height '' then select the `` large '' then `` save '' . . khalas = -RRB-
re : how to resize the picture to upload
there is a much easier way . download microsoft image resizer . its a power toy for windows . all you do once installed is right click the image and you can resize to a predefined or a custom size . http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=211477 small download only 520kb .
re : how to resize the picture to upload
if you have microsoft office picture manager , you can just open the imagine in picture manage , and then edit picture , re-size picture to reduce the resolution and save as jpeg to reduce the size on disk .

parent visa for above 70 year age
i like to bring my parent for 1 or two weeks in qatar.i tried for tourist visa at airport.but , they rejected.now , authority advice to book only five star hotel for tourist visa.it is impossible to spend money for five star hotel for me.is it possible anytype -LRB- including tourist -RRB- of visa , which can bring my parent here?if so , please send form and tell me process . thanks in advance .
re : parent visa for above 70 year age
no . there are no visas available easily for persons above 60 years of age . the hotel-sponsored visa is the only type . you need not approach a five-star hotel for this . there are several cheaper hotels in doha which can sponsor such a visa . the cost would be around us $ 100 to us $ 150 per day , depending upon how much the hotel charges for one room per night .
re : parent visa for above 70 year age
agreed with metro
re : parent visa for above 70 year age
got to the hukoomi website . once there select the tourist visa section then select a joint tourist visa and fill in the form for each parent , you will need their passport details . i did this last year for my parents , both over 70 . be careful though as you only get 1 month from the date of creation so make sure it covers them for the whole stay , you can not choose a start date . they give you an instant answer and it only cost 100 riyals per visa . good luck : -RRB-
re : parent visa for above 70 year age
go to immigration department and ask someone there . i have heard that there are people who can get you a visa for over 60 parents but he will charge you for his service . please dont send me any pm that 's all i have heard .

i was involved in a networking site , their i met a guy and chat with him as a gay later we exchanged the contact no and promise to meet and i was caught by cid as he is a spy . i dont know the case was treated as minor or major . during interrogation they taken my signature in a document , which i couldnt understand as it was in arabic language and they take my pics and freed . actually m in delimma to quit the job or go for a vacation . if the case is major then during the process of visa cancellation my company knows abt it and it was leak to everyone and sure i ll loose all my benefits . and if i ll go for my vacation and resign then also my company will not pay my benifits . please give advice
re : what will happen if anyone have a case in police or ...
my friend can i ask you ? , why you are signing the document & you have n't got the idea of what was the content of it ? this is serious matter , my opinion 1 day you will be arrested so better to go there and check it to the immigration if theres a travel ban issued to you & try to go to the court & present your qid there & ask if theres any case filed against you cause sometimes the trials may proceed without you & they will just arrest you when the decision came out ...
re : what will happen if anyone have a case in police or ...
thanks to all for your advice , so according to you all i hav to check in immigration dept any travel ban issued or not , if not i can go otherwise i hav to clear this case . this incident happened 6 months before . is their any online facility to check my status ?

satellite tv and internet
2 questions : 1 . what is the current quality of internet in doha ? is it fast enough compared to other western countries ? can you livestream videos fast enough ? 2 . are there any satellite broadcasts which show australian sport ? i 'm wanting to watch the nrl which airs every week when i head there next year . usually on fox sports and channel 9 . thanks .
re : satellite tv and internet
internet is fine , unlimited and able to cope with streaming no problem . expensive though especially compared to uk . satellite here is pretty rubbish both in quality and choice . hopefully some ozzies can confirm but certainly have seen nz rugby on one of the channels .

you can get fox sports here on the osn satellite network . try looking on the listings www.osnetwork.com to see if they are carrying the games you want -LRB- hopefully they 're not time delayed -RRB-
re : satellite tv and internet
osn shows live nrl , plus afl and most rugby so its a pretty good sports package if you are from down under . currently they are showing the ashes live which is great .

no you can not enter , but you can avail the services of al maha meet and greet services who can do that all for you .
re : is it possible to enter doha airport with out a. . .
al maha is good , however you need to provide them with the details at least 48 hours before their arrival time and i think its about 600qr for 2 ppl but im not sure . just call qatar airways and ask the exact details .
re : is it possible to enter doha airport with out a. . .
no way , you cant get in . ask them to call a worker staniding infornt of the luggage belt . it 's a matter of 25 qr .
re : is it possible to enter doha airport with out a. . .
not possible and i belive no need jut pass all information to them .
re : is it possible to enter doha airport with out a. . .
there is a marhaba service who can assist them with immigration and baggage . you ca n't .
re : is it possible to enter doha airport with out a. . .
marycatherine , perhaps , you meant al maha services . . consider going to the al maha counter for a hassle free service . give your families flight iterinary to the al maha agent inside the arrival terminal and pay a small fee for their services . once your family arrives at the arrival terminal , ask them to proceed to the al maha outlet before the immigration counter to their left . . tell them to announce to the al maha representative about their names . they will be asked to wait in the spacious and comfortable lounge . an al maha rep will collect their passports and visas and clear their immigration for them and then come back to collect your family in 10 minutes . your family will be lead through the immigration counter to the baggage pickup area counter where they can identify their luggages . they will direct someone to load the luggages onto a trolley and walk out near the public area where you can identify them cheers

international driving licence is valid for 1 year . take your driving license , two passport size photos and go to a travel agent such as regency travels or mannai travels , they will charge you 100 to 150 riyals and will give you the international license within few minutes .

very urgent pls pls help new born visa
my baby born in qatar ,7 days old has got one year visit visa as my wife and myself both r on different sponsorship . my query is that now i want to go to india and comebck within a month . so if v live the country and comeback will there b any problem for my baby to re enter qatar as his visa is one year visit visa -LCB- as per rule they issued visit bcoz mother is not on hubands sponsorship -RCB-
re : very urgent pls pls help new born visa
one year visit visa ????? what is this ? somebody give u wrong information . i think this is a residence visa if visa printed as - entry purpose-family vis & expiry date one year from birth date me and my wife are under different sponsor i have one year old baby and my daughters visa printed as family visit we visit india two times last year
re : very urgent pls pls help new born visa
i think you 're having a wrong picture in your mind . if your baby is born in qatar , he/she will not be issued with visit visa . visit visa is issued only to a person outside qatar and for the purpose of visiting . if you have done the birth certificate and have signed the documents at cid -LRB- due to 2 sponsers for you and your wife -RRB- , your baby is issued with the rp . i think it 's better you show your babys rp -LRB- or visa as you say -RRB- to somebody who can read arabic and get confirmed .
re : very urgent pls pls help new born visa
something not right here ... my husband and i are with different sponsors . our baby was born a few months back , and was issued a family visa . quite straightforward . the only extra step is u 'll need to go to the cid office and show them ur papers . once the baby gets his passport , u 'll need to go back there with a copy of the passport . -LRB- no idea why though -RRB-

fuwayrit beach
we are planning to go to fuwayrit city soon . anybody can sketch me how to reach there . thanks in advance .
re : fuwayrit beach
hit up al shamal road and start counting your distance from landmark shopping mall . keep heading north on al shamal road -LRB- not al khor road which takes you straight to al khor and passes the lusail intl. circuit on your left -RRB- for about 75.55 km you will come to an interchange -LRB- still under construction -RRB- with a small blue sign before the bridge reading -LSB- al fuwairit > -RSB- you will want to take the dirt road with that sign and keep driving down a very bumpy road until you hit the fishing village . to get to the beach , take a left before the village and follow the unpaved roads to the beach . got a gps ? also , would n't recommend going there without a 4x4 , some spots have nasty soft sand . check it out on google earth before you go . feel free to pm . good luck !
re : fuwayrit beach
head northwest to al shamal road . landmark set km to `` 0 '' after 77kms turn right . after 3.9 kms turn left for 450meters . youl be in the area .
re : fuwayrit beach
whaiql 's blog is really nice , with pictures too . you turn left just before you enter the village , the road looks like the 5th picture from the top in whaiql 's blog . trees on either side and a wooden barricade . again , to the 4x4 issue , some spots do have soft sand . you can probably find a way through on hard ground though . it 's not an unpopular beach , so if you do get stuck , there should be someone around to dig you out , especially on the weekends .

ooh wait , if your family is going to send them on through regular post , it could sometimes take months for your books to get here . my advice is to find a mail forwarding service in the uk . we have one in the us . i order from anywhere , they send the order to my po box in florida , then the mail forwarding service sends it through dhl and it gets delivered to my husband 's office here . it is kind of expensive , but our items get here in 3 to 4 days from leaving florida . motherhood ... the hardest job you 'll ever love ! : -RRB-

do to help you until you heal up ? if you are still itchy . . try pulverizing dry oatmeal and putting it in a tub of lukewarm water and sitting until you ca n't stand the cold anymore ... helps you from wanting to scratch yourself to death . grant me the senility to forget the people i never liked , the good fortune to run into the ones i do , and the eyesight to tell the difference .
might ask a doc , but
if you can get ano nighttime antihistamines that should help with the itching also . . valtrex is an antiviral med ... and although the chickenpox is viral , it wo n't really help with the itching . you will also be contagious until the very last pox has dried up and fallen off ... so take your time and get well !!! grant me the senility to forget the people i never liked , the good fortune to run into the ones i do , and the eyesight to tell the difference .

what driving school is the best ?
i am planning to get a driving license but i am not sure which driving school i should go . any suggestions ?
re : what driving school is the best ?
al-khebra - not because i got the license in first test but also for school 's environment and professionalism as compared to other schools . before taking admission there i had visited other schools as well . al-khebra is easily reachable as well . i was enrolled for full course -LRB- 40 days -RRB- but i passed in 20 days alhamdulillah -LRB- attended only 12 classes in practicle :-RRB- . my instructor was randy -LRB- filipino -RRB- . hope it helps u

clothes prices in doha ?
i am wondering if the prices in doha are higher than in the uk . can there be good deals on sale like lets say jeans for 60-100 qr ? just want to get an idea . thanks
re : clothes prices in doha ?
i think clothes prices are higher in uk than here . . but it 's always wiser to buy clothes during sale season as u can really get good deals during those times . .
re : clothes prices in doha ?
it depends on the brand . as a general rule most uk brands -LRB- such as bhs , next , m & s , h & m -RRB- are priced at an exchange rate of qr7 to 1 . as the current rate is closer to qr5 to 1 clothes will be cheaper in the uk . on top of this retailers are discounting heavily in the uk because of the recession . if you look at some french or spanish brands -LRB- zara -RRB- they are cheaper in doha .
re : clothes prices in doha ?
i agree that now the exchange rate is so low then clothes are deifnitely cheaper back in uk especially with the great sales that are on there at the moment . unless you buy from a recognised brand here the quality is not very good , so my is advice take a holiday back in uk and fill your suitcase with all the bargains there !!
re : clothes prices in doha ?
a pair of undies are costing qr 45 here ...
re : clothes prices in doha ?
thanks , guys . that was really helpful . i am still in the uk . but soon will be moving.i am going to bring everything from here i guess . as the prices here are fantastic now like linen trousers at next on sale are 8 -LRB- 44 qrs -RRB- . so do n't think anything could beat that on price and quality .
re : clothes prices in doha ?
yes u cud surely get a pair of jeans for 60qr ... but that was sooo 5 years ago !
re : clothes prices in doha ?
um . i 'm sure clothing prices in uk is more expensive than in doha . 60-100 riyal jeans ? you could work on that . i 'm sure there 's a place where you can find a good deal . ; o -RRB-

re : medical exam for visa
your employer should be helping you this , but you need to take your passport , 100qr -LRB- fees -RRB- , and the paper that was printed out from your sponsor . when you get there just ask where to sit and wait for your turn .

re : medical exam for visa
try to make your medical test and a chest x-ray in medical commission in abu hamour -LRB- mesaimeer area -RRB- , take your passport , visa and 2 photos . results will be over after 3 days , you can pick them up on the same place . then go to any other clinic -LRB- lab -RRB- to make or confirm blood group , it is over after few minutes . the last thing is to go to electronic fingerprinting-mesaimeer services centre . they will inform you when you should come again and they will print your visa in passport and you will get id .

how to avoid burning of steel while cooking ??
dear friends , can you tell me that how can stainless steel items can be prevented from burning during cooking on gas oven . one by one , such items are getting black burning marks while cooking on gas/fire oven . . urgent response required especially from house wives
re : how to avoid burning of steel while cooking ??
to avoid burning ur pot while ur cooking ??? 1 . presence of mind 2 . common sense 3 . low fire 4 . clean the stove after cooking 5 . stir it from time to time specially dal soup if u do this u will avoid burning with ur pot 's .
re : how to avoid burning of steel while cooking ??
if you are talking about the <b> outside </b> of a pot , rub a bar of soap all over the outside . my husband is an avid outdoorsman & backpacker and this is the method he uses when cooking over an open fire ... always works .
re : how to avoid burning of steel while cooking ??
keep the flame to low or if you want fast cooking , apply claymud at the bottem of vessels.this way you can avoid !!

re : are dogs allowed at the corniche in qatar
technically there 's nothing to stop you , but people have been accosted by unhappy locals and the police have been called on some occasions . better to find a baron patch of land somewhere . it 's not likd there are n't plenty of areas like that around !

italians in doha
hi , i 've just received an offer for an expat job in doha , some 120.000 $ and i 'm wondering if there is an italian comunity there diego
no imnatroll
i make more than that and i am not a treasury specialist :--RRB- -RRB- rofl !!!!
verisimilitude
my ceo earns hell no . of times than him . he is also not a treasury analyst right ? . what if you are in a bigger position than him ? : -RRB-

i see , do you have a full expat package ?
i 've noticed a lot of people
i 've noticed a lot of people mentioning their salary on qatarliving . ~ * speak when you are angry and you will make the best speech you will ever regret * ~
okay ... seriously ...
i know a bunch of guys in one of the multinational banks in treasury who make more than that and this was two years ago ... having said that , i am no expert on finance ... all i know is that these were guys with about 10 to 15 years work ex like lorenteggio ...
loren ...
if its one of the national banks , the offer would be less than that of some of the multinational financial institutions ... ` some ' ... not all ...
lorenteggio , it is alright .
lorenteggio , it is alright . you are not the first person to do so . but its just the way people could ask . maybe something like , how much would suffice for a good life in qatar . people on qatarliving vary in status and the salaries vary as well . people earn qr2000 to qr 150000 a month . so , it might hurt people to know that others are making what they would save in 350 years . just my opinion . i wish you a happy stay in qatar once you arrive . ~ * speak when you are angry and you will make the best speech you will ever regret * ~
check the groups tab . and
check the groups tab . and oh , no need to mention your salary :--RRB- usapa na ...

not yet decided , we will see
there is a thriving community ...
there is a thriving community ... with a very active embassy . but why do you italian guys keep switching-off the aircon and opening the windows ? ... lol
ciao lorenteggio i 'm not in
ciao lorenteggio i 'm not in finance so could n'tcomment how that offer compares with the local rate , but i would say that you have to judge how much better of you 'll be than at home . cost of living is definitely higher than in italy , but depends a lot if you have accomodation included . you 're going to pay at least qar14 ,000 per month for somewhere ok to live . if it 's only a little above average salary at home then i 'd say it is n't going to make you a lot better off , but this depends on your tax situation . not sure how the italian tax works , but no tax payable here . you have to bear in mind that while qatar is very safe and you can buy most things here -LRB- prosciuto excepted ! -RRB- , it 's not the most comfortable or exciting place to live . so you 'll end up spending a lot on flights and holidays to stay sane . good luck fg

how to track lost mobile ?
one of my friend lost his costly mobiles yesterday nite @ around 10 pm -LRB- two mobiles , htc hd2 and sony ericsson m600i -RRB- in karwa taxi while travelling back from ramada to matar qadeem . whether it should be reported to police or we can approach karwa office ? what will be feasible . . ? suggestions please ...
re : how to track lost mobile ?
i 'd suggest you try both .
re : how to track lost mobile ?
wow looks very costly get the imei number from the box of each cell phone that it to capital police and they will do their work
re : how to track lost mobile ?
i agree with first answer to report both
re : how to track lost mobile ?
mmm . . lost world dude
re : how to track lost mobile ?
there is option in iphone 4 to trace your lost mobile and you can view it in map that where is located , i fond my one in philippians , lol , haha , but i got my one through that ,
re : how to track lost mobile ?
well here is the thing , it depends upon the system in place . if they want they can trace the mobile phone with approximate location . there is an imei of each mobile mobile . and when ever a mobile phone get registered to the network or makes a phone call or sends sms , there is an entry recorded in database with sim number + imei number . so if someone is using your friend 's mobile phone , they definitely have the record of it . and they can trace the guy as well . the best way is to goto police and report it .
re : how to track lost mobile ?
do not worry . go to police station and they will register your complain and through your imie no they will trace your the lost phone even your cell is off even he remove your sim card . through imei police will trace the guy as well .

there should be small white sticker attached in your passport that has the date of entry to doha and the expiry date -LRB- or your visa extention date -RRB- . so that incase police checks the validity of your stay in doha , it will be easier . better visit immigration office in madinat khalifa to validate the authenticity for your own safety .

is it true dat unmarried couples need 2bvery cautious while roaming around places in qatar . . ?
hey guys n gals out der im new 2dis place . . and i heard dat one should b very careful while takin ur luv out 4a ride or even wen ur alone out . . dey say its serious checking going around here is it ... ??
re : is it true dat unmarried couples need 2bvery cautious ...
me and my girlfriend are often dating here in doha . . almost evryday . . for almost 2 yrs.i think it 's safe here , nothing to worry about .
re : is it true dat unmarried couples need 2bvery cautious ...
qatar is an islam country . to let you understand , try to have a date in saudi arabia with your girlfriend and if you would be lucky enough - you would see what i mean . dating with your girlfriend here in the middle east is unacceptable to islam tradition !!
re : is it true dat unmarried couples need 2bvery cautious ...
rule number 1 : do not hold hands . rule number 2 : do not kiss . rule number 3 : do not hug for more than 3 seconds . rule number 4 : do not attempt fornication of any kind whatsoever -LRB- especially in public -RRB- . rule number 5 : if any of the above rules are flouted , make sure you lock room , draw curtains and increase volume of the music to a substantial level .
re : is it true dat unmarried couples need 2bvery cautious ...
qatar is a very safe country , there is no problem here for dating but you have to keep in mind that this is an islamic country and have to respect the laws of qatar . try not to get carried away in public ...
re : is it true dat unmarried couples need 2bvery cautious ...
yes it is true mostly now a days b care ful
re : is it true dat unmarried couples need 2bvery cautious ...
its true . be careful . try not to jump on your date .
re : is it true dat unmarried couples need 2bvery cautious ...
as long as you both dont go overboard with pda no worries ... ... . .
re : is it true dat unmarried couples need 2bvery cautious ...
hi.this country has its own culture that we both expatriates and locals to be aware of , hence should be followed . you ca n't blame anybody once you got into these kinds of troubles . so better you always bear in mind that you are working and living in a country where traditional values are strictly being adapted and observed by the authorities . good luck
re : is it true dat unmarried couples need 2bvery cautious ...
you need to be careful even if you take your dad out for a drive , rules of traffic , otherwise you could endanger safety of the road .

std check up
you should have your own lab with experience in lab tests . ha hahaaa `` helping hands r better than praying lips ''
anjuraj / victory_278692
go to rumailla hospitol and meet dr. abdul lattif or sister ameera . they will conduct the test . `` forum ... . . test conducted clinically , results declared confidentially with your sponsor and deport publicly ... '' results will not be available to anybody -LRB- strictly confidential -RRB- . you will not be deported but you will be treated with best medicine available in the world . free of charge . there was an article written by dr. lattif on gulf times sometime back on hiv issue in qatar .
dear lucky ...
god forbid , if the result is + ve hiv/aids ; the patient will definitely get the best medicine in the world and off course free but he/she is to sacrifice the job and leave the country being an expat , the treatmetn will be different with a local ! ... the real stories will never get published in the newspapers .
victory_278692
there are 2 senarios . if you detect possitive during your medical test for rp . you will be deported . however , if you detect positive after obtaining rp you will not be deported but treated with best medicine available in the world . free of charge .

then publish the detail on this forum ... may this will assist genuine cases in future ... i like your title ` big boss from cia ' thanks for info ... people comment here on whatever personal or someone already experienced .

are there any qualifications to join the group filipino expatriates in qatar ?
i have tried to ask membership from the modulator but he never replied nor approved the request ... i was just wondering are there any qualifications or other members should invite you first ?
re : are there any qualifications to join the group ...
no qualification required ... as far as i can recall .
re : are there any qualifications to join the group ...
since you 're over 50 pts you are welcome just click the <i> request membership </i> and wait for group admin approval .
re : are there any qualifications to join the group ...
check the guidelines on their group homepage .
re : are there any qualifications to join the group ...
i have requested membership for months then i tried again today but it seems that they do n't approve just anyone . i have my other friend applied for membership for months now she never hot approved either . i just feel sad i really want to belong to a group of people of my own culture and interest . but anyways ... all i can do is wait ! ; -RRB-
re : are there any qualifications to join the group ...
just a guess , maybe the moderator is outside qatar , vacationing in philippines , he/she does n't have internet connection . name it ... .

i 'll try to get an appraisal
i 'll try to get an appraisal in toyota trade-in section . if their offer will not suits my expectation , then probably this goes for an auction to direct buyers anyone knows how much the market value for this model ?
yes . trade in is less
yes . trade in is less problem/head ache but less cost . sell it to direct buyers will earn you little sum of money compare to trade-in but you have to deal with different types of people .
as others are saying , a
as others are saying , a trade-in is less hassle for you , but you 'll get much less money for the vehicle . selling it to a private buyer will get your more money but it will be much more of a hassle and potentially take a long time .
btw , what much is ur demand
btw , what much is ur demand for lc 2004 model ?? would you like to share with us here . .
i do n't have accurate demand

try both and see who gives
try both and see who gives you the best price !
sell it outside , there is no
sell it outside , there is no way that toyota dealership will pay you fair . definitely much lower than market price so they can have profit for re-selling .

client approval
hi , i have accepted offer to work in qatar as a civil engineer , but the company told me not to hand my notice in until get the client approval . i have not come across this client approval before . i would appreciate your advice and any idea how long this approval will take and is it easy to get this approval ? thanks for your help in advance . mego
no , it 's client approval
no , it 's client approval which is approval should be taken from the main project client before starting the visa process .
sounds like good advice from
sounds like good advice from your employer
yes , true they should get
yes , true they should get prior approval from the client or consultant before they are able to hire you , means a copy of your cv is sent to them as well and you might be interviewed by them too . .
all jobs in qatar on
all jobs in qatar on contingent on your getting a visa , so even if you come and go through the last few stages , your visa may or may not be approved . you would have to leave then and no compensation would be provided . only you can decide if you want to take that leap . thousands are successful , but if you are one of the very few who are not it can be devastating .
it is the time required to
it is the time required to get your cv approved by the ultimate client -LRB- ashghal etc. -RRB- . it 's for your benefit to get you approved before you hand your notice . as someone mentioned the visa process may still collapse but at least the client approval stage will confirm that the client will pay for your work lol . your grade and salary is likely to be based on that as well . it took approx . 10-14 days in my case .
any more thoughts
any more thoughts
yes , client approval is
yes , client approval is generally the preferred way to work for engineering consultancies . the main reason is that companies dont want to hire someone from overseas and bring them all the way to qatar and then find out that the client does not like them for some reasons like lack of experience , etc. therefore , to save themselves the hassle and money , companies usually hire people officially once client has seen their cv and is happy to have them on the job . hope this helps !

prado is perfect .
prado is perfect .
hello omar !
your question is difficult to answer and the only person who knows the answer is you.if you want a mean powerful offroader that can seat 7 in comfort then prado is your choice . on the other hand you want a slick city cruiser that can manage minimal offroading then go for the cr-v . it looks real nice if you mod it just right . both cars are good value for money . if it is the 2.4 l prado you are looking at then definitely go for cr-v as the 2.4 l mill which performs well in the camry is n't good enough to get the gargantuan across town . ride comfort is higher in the cr-v and handling is near saloon levels . the prado on the other hand is belittled by the humble corolla around a round about . road noise levels are also higher in the prado especially when wearing bridgestone donuts . you also get more toys for the money you pay on a cr-v . prado can go just about anywhere with it 's optional 4wd system with rear and central diff lock . it 's got a huge petrol tank that takes ages to fill and ages to empty . the value never depreciates and looks like it never will as the 2010 prado may soon turn out to be damp squib and a possible chink in toyota 's armor as full time 4wd may not be everyone 's cup of tea . in the end listen to your heart . if you need further help pm me as i just love cars and all things related ... also check out www.drivearabia.com for more opinions and reviews .

re : where to buy plants ?
we got our from the vegetable market on salwa road - from ramada , past decoration roundabout and u-turn at the next roundabout behind the shops . they also sell pots and will pot the plant for you free of charge if you buy both .
re : where to buy plants ?
yes above answers are correct , you can go there at 5 or 6pm the shops are open . salwa road , whole sale market not only plants are there , vegetables , fruits , fish . . anything !
re : where to buy plants ?
i will suggest you green land nursery , its in between aramex roundabout & mamoura signal -LRB- new mamoura complex -RRB- if you are coming from doha , cross d ring road signal & mammoura signal , go straight 200 meters on your right ... near archidron construction office .

contaminated mineral water
does anybody know where we can register our complain regarding the contaminated water ? i have few sealed bottles of branded mineral water with black particles .
re : contaminated mineral water
you can contact the head of dept for the food control dept at 4347633 . maybe they can assist you .
re : contaminated mineral water
in normal situations the doha municipality is responsible for carrying out inspections in this regard . as mentioned , complaints can be made through the municipality website www.baladiya.gov.qa under the food observation section . alternatively , they can be reached on food observation section - doha municipality phone number : 4347631 - 4347663
re : contaminated mineral water
i also recommend going public through the papers , i believe they have the most impact in such cases . retailers have screwed up one time too many , and this needs to stop . i still can remember buying expired diapers for my infant from city center 's major retail shop , only to be given a cold shoulder by the manager and an offer for a credit note , at the end i made sure they learned their lesson <grin>
re : contaminated mineral water
can u share us what brand these bottles so that we take precausion ...

sony soundforge can do that .
sony soundforge can do that . it extracts the audio from the cd and you can save it then in whichever format you want .

yes , basically : the . cda
yes , basically : the . cda files are representations of cd audio tracks and do not contain the actual pulse code modulation -LRB- pcm -RRB- information . cda files can be played only from a cd-rom . this means you have to ` rip ' the song from the cd using a software , there are plenty of them around the net -LRB- i 've been using soundforge and it 's very cool even if maybe is quite difficult for a newbie to understand -RRB- .
i am sure you can use
i am sure you can use ashampoo to rip it and convert it to mp3 . perhaps other softwares such as nero can do it as well ... i am not aware . google search , perhaps you find a freeware for that purpose .

can my wife get a job on my work permit ?
hello all , we are in the process of relocating to doha . i will be issued a work permit that will allow my wife and kid to be resident too . but can my wife get a job using this permit ? or will she will be able to get a work permit easily once in country and able to secure another job ? pls help as this is very important to us . it might determine if my wife will agree to leave her current job in the uk or not . thanks
no problem
yes , as you have a family status your wife can get a job here . she will be in your sponsorship and once she has a job offer the company would be applying for a job permit . the thing you have to consider is her chances of getting a job as it depends also on her experience and minimum salary you would be expecting . anyways may god guide you . cheers , steve
you are welcome
yes , once she gets her resident visa then her employer can apply for the job permit . cheers , steve

how can i get into a password protected internet network ?

how in the sam hills you persist being annoying ?
re : how can i get into a password protected internet ...
errrm ... is n't that the whole point of it being password protected - to stop people ` borrowing ' their internet connection ? two options - ask for the password - or get your own interent . and what do mean ` borrow ' ? this implies a short term loan period after which you re-pay or return . so , do you intend to return the internet usage you have ` borrowed ' ?

difference between netbook and note book

buy a netbook ! i have 2 laptops and a netbook ; when this netbook came , i seldom touch my laptops ; netbooks can go 8hrs without recharging ; very light that you can carry it whenever you go out ; connects to wherever there is a hotspot ; does everything a laptop does ; and its a lot cheaper than laptops unfortunately , it was confiscated by my daughter on my last vacation

cherry , make sure before you report anything , you have to provide a solid proof of evidences or anything that leads to harassment . this is qatar you can not just go to police and tell them that you are being harassed by your boss . make a seamless recording -LRB- sounds or video -RRB- or photos from mobile that he can not recognize . always turn on your mobile videos before talking to your boss by simply holding your mobile , -LRB- at least voice can be recorded -RRB- .
cherry
call 999 now and complain , the police will give u full support and they will arrest ur boss -LRB- lebanese -RRB- if they terminate you the immigration officer will give you release and u can find another sponsor ... chow cheer up men .
uhh why do i get the feeling

yes sure you enjoyed it and ended up in hospital with energy drips going up your body
cherry ...
ofcourse ur job is important , but u ca n't continue ur job like this . may be the situation will become worse.so better collect some proof and report to higher person than him in ur co. or report it to police . collect proof first . . using pen cam as darude suggested . . or ur mobile -LRB- if it has recording option -RRB- .

take print of this thread & give it your boss .
tinker
they sucked out all his power and the poor guy had to crawl to the hospital .
two choices
it seems you are left with two choices , either to give in or to make a bold resistance . hope you find the wisdom to do the latter without compromising .
you should be prepared of
you should be prepared of those things before coming here . do n't be stupid scared . be smart . outsmart him . be cunning . and do n't let money be a reason of your demise . pera lang yan .
indecent proposal ... whatchamacallit ... whatever ... you are weak
if you think you are weak ! i 'm not being biotchy but : - <b> to cherry23 </b> : your company have an hr officer , right ? why not discuss this with them ... to give it appropriate action . secondly , if you gon na complain to the police , you better stand firm with your complaints ... as this would be a long , tedious , messy situation wherein your work will get jeopardized in the process . they ould easily turn the table on you , you being new in the job , in the company . it ' ; ; be your words against your manager . third , maybe your manager misread your actions towards him . you being amiable to him and friendly may have been read/understood that you like him ... maybe you should do a self-assessment . fourth , if you really want to keep your job and the sexual harrassment to stop ... tell him frankly . he 's educated enough to take the point . he may do something stupid for being rejected but as long as you do your job well , he ca n't have anything to use against you to terminate you . from what you 're posting about the situation being `` complicated '' ... it 's not . you want the money for the overtime he 's giving you ... but you do n't like the attention ... then speak out your thoughts and tell him that you came here to work and earn ... not to do any tomfoolery ... i hope you get my point ... and do n't be so naive .
tinkerbell10 - i just hope
tinkerbell10 - i just hope you are right . but at least she should have move away from that pervert and not letting him kissed her . because this guy can say `` ohh . . she is not resisting , i can do what i want '' .
cherry something is not right
cherry something is not right here ... you say that lately he has started kissing your neck ... hello - but how does he get that close to kiss you on your neck ?? its not an easy thing to do so he has to be pretty close and comfortable to be able to do that and what about you ?? you just stand there quietly while he does it . i know one thing , if any guy came that close to me i would certainly notice and move away ... so i tend to think there is more to the story . . maybe you were nice and cosy with the guy and now that he wants more you are panicking ... and to tell him you have a bf well thats just real clever ... sorry i dont buy your story - there is something else you are not telling us ...
and another thing ... i am
and another thing ... i am sure your office/company has a complaint policy or greivance policy ... why go to police and make it into some great big story of he knows this and that person ... simple answer - report to your hr department or to his boss and get it over and done with ... like i said before - big story for nothing and there is something you have not told us which is basically that you would rather have the money etc then complain about him . where is your pride !!!!
if you are really interested
if you are really interested in getting this guy off your back , draw the line in stone , not sand . most guys do understand when a woman replies with a firm `` no '' , and they usually back off . it 's when you keep moving the line that they start playing around . so be strong and say `` no , thankyou , not interested '' . you have to decide what is more important to you , a few measly extra bucks or your self respect and dignity .
cherry
its simple , dont be a dumb!do what is the best to caught this guy .
hit directly his forehead
hit directly his forehead then sign ur name ! hahahahahaha ! is there any company here selling teargas ???
you told an arab guy you had a `` boyfriend '' ?
you told an arab guy you had a `` boyfriend '' ? you seem to be too new here ... you have to tell them `` married '' and not shaging with `` boyfriend-s '' ...
cherry listen do this and
cherry listen do this and think about it ... your boss is lebaness so the higher boss is qatari , dont worry to lose your job because he is only a gm there but he is not your sponsor , the qatari is the one who will kick him out of the office . . if you not scared now . . this are the step . . before entering your boss office take your mobile with u and start recording something . . if u can do video more solid evidence and voice record is good also but u need or conversation is involved about harrasing to u , do u get what i mean . if you get that go to the police ... or use that evidence to scare him away ... and dont smile on him dont give him anything to deserve your kindness . . trust me on this ... because we are the same on this kind of situation ... in this country u need to be strong and smart specially to us girls . .
. . tell your bf about your
. . tell your bf about your problem , maybe he can help you also .
@jackmohan2007
ahihi ... `` boyfriend-s ''
amazing that this would even be a question .
is it so common in qatar that women are victims of these kinds of wankers and have to ask people what to do because they assume there is no justice for women here ? anywhere else i think this would be a given : report him to his superior and the police .

bad advice
hey guys out here advising this person to report to the bigger boss is more stupid then the original act as the bigger boss is more busy having a good time himslf at the companys expense and the lower manager knows exactly what the big boss is upto and what he needs to do to keep him quiet and happy so he also can go about his dirty tricks and harassment while the big boss is at his own tricks and games

language barrier
we are an english speaking family planning to bring a maid from indonesia who can not communicate at all in english . please guide me how i could train her to speak english , since she will be taking care of my kids .
re : language barrier
there is no point of bringing her my dear . because the time needed to teach her enlish wont be less then the time needed for you kid to be a teenager my advice , go find another one best of luck
re : language barrier
i find they pick up language quickly but you will need to speak to her non-stop all the time . maybe this will not be ideal if both of you are working and the kids are st home . i find it helps when she plays with the kids a lot as kids have a great deal of patience and they feel more comfortable around the kids than adults as there is little embarrasment .
re : language barrier
a real need open all doors . there is no barier , i am sure your kids will speak bhasha indonesia.right now shaikh 's sons and daughters are speaking tamil -LRB- they have two tamil maids -RRB-

is it difficult to be vegan in doha ?
hi i 'm considering moving to doha and have been vegan for 4 years . i 'm wondering how difficult it is to find vegan food products - things like soy milk , tofu , nutritional yeast ... any vegans in doha have any insight ? thanks !
re : is it difficult to be vegan in doha ?
soy milk and tofu are available in all major supermarkets but i am not sure about the yeast .
re : is it difficult to be vegan in doha ?
there are a lot of vegans here , mainly from the subcontinent . i do n't know about the yeast in particular but the rest is available anywhere .
re : is it difficult to be vegan in doha ?
great ! thanks cherukkan and marycatherine . good to know i 'll be in good company and wo n't starve ! pollyj there are lots of great reasons to be vegan : animal rights , health , lower environmental impact and peace of mind to name a few . i feel much healthier since becoming vegan . i have more energy , i do n't get as tired after eating meals , i lost weight and i 'm happier knowing my actions are inline with my thoughts and ethics . of course , everyone is different and for some people -LRB- like boer -RRB- its harder to give up the things they 've always loved . for me it was a great choice and i 've never looked back . give it a go ! i promise it 's not as hard as you think !
re : is it difficult to be vegan in doha ?
you wouldnt have a problem being vegan in doha , besides lacking the daiya cheese that i love so much . check out some indian restaurants around !

can i buy gold in qatar
hi , i will be travelling to qatar in the first quarter of 2009 . i heard that gold and other electronics goods are cheaper in qatar when compared to other countries . could you suggest me the things which are cheap in qatar and reasonably high in india . i also heard that gold is one among them . can someone give me some pointers on what can be purchased in qatar .
gold is the same price the
gold is the same price the world around . the only difference is the `` making charge '' and tax for some countries such as egypt . dubai probably has the least extra price on top of the gold 's value for that day . if you do n't know the day 's price for , say , 22k gold , do n't try to buy some . the merchant will have you figured out in a flash . mandi
yes
same prices but the desgins are totally different from any were else
i found three items here in
i found three items here in qatar are cheaper than in india 1 . petrol 2 . saffron 3 . dates -LRB- but you have to collect it from the road side palm tree -RRB-
not true !
i think you heard it wrong from somebody , compare to saudi and dubai , all the stuff are much costlier here . so , think twice before you pick something from qatar . yeah , you will get pure gold from any gcc country than india . happy shopping !!!! .
gold price in qatar higher than india
in qatar gold price is cheap compare than india , but making charges are high . so final comparsion qatar rates are higher than india exampletoday rate in india u can have 1 gm -LRB- 22ct -RRB- 1250 , but qatar 1 gm -LRB- 22ct -RRB- 100qr -LRB- inclulde making charge -RRB- = 1310 .

will egypt turn into pakistan ?
after the hard fought gains of the revolution it seems the prize of the egyptians might be for them to mirror events in pakistan . an army that is always involved in the politics , corruption from all sides and frequently changing governments . no country can prosper and move forward without stability and with the army interfering once more in politics does the next decade for egypt look like the last decade for pakistan ?
indeed brit , but in pakistan
indeed brit , but in pakistan supreme court is taking things in to their hand ... just like the disqualification of pm of pakistan yesterday ...
oh dear the election result

moza : change does not come
moza : change does not come from a vote until after the civil war has begun , been fought and one side has won , then the vote means something .
i think politicians our worst
i think politicians our worst then our army ... be it marshal law or democratic government , corruption is every where , but then again why do more then 75 % of pakistanis support the army ... egypt never had revolution in the first place , face was changed but until now egyptian army are calling the shots . .
hi
hey idiot ,
special ed schools
it looks like we might be headed to doha with my 11 year-old son with down syndrome , and we 've been scouring the internet for schools . we are looking for recommendations from anyone who has first-hand knowledge of special ed for an 11 year-old , or can refer us to someone or an organization with any information . also , does anyone know of a down syndrome support group ? many thanks ! sam
yes either shaffalah or the
yes either shaffalah or the learning centre , both part of qatar foundation . aisha-taweela
check with shaffalah and the
check with shaffalah and the learning centre as noted above , but you may not find the same type of programs you are accustomed to in north america - not saying they 're bad or anything , but different . conditions like down 's syndrome exist here as they do everywhere in the world - however , often children are not seen - what i mean is , they 're often kept at home , where they will be safe but exposure to the outside world is limited . not all parents do this of course , but whereas in north america i 'm never surprised to see someone with a disability -LRB- whether physical , mental , or congenital -RRB- at the mall or the grocery store or the movies - it 's unusual enough here for me to `` notice '' them on a conscious level . this is merely an fyi in terms of adjusting to the local `` culture '' on this issue , another point is that many people from the subcontinent `` stare '' at people and things they consider to be different -LRB- hey , i 'm one of them when i go out for a walk with the dog , i try to look at it as i 'm a form of entertainment - half of the dog and pony show so to speak -RRB- it can be disconcerting especially when you first arrive . i 'm sure you and your family would be able to get along fine and i hope the programs on offer at these organizations will be useful . signature line > `` you ca n't fix stupid ''
do n't even think about it .
do n't even think about it . you might be able to get a place in a mainstream school provided you pay for a special needs assistant -LRB- untrained -RRB- for your son . do n't come .

compass takes special needs . i know of at least one family who has a down 's child there , although i have no idea of the severity . i would contact them to see if they can help otherwise , as others have said , i would n't come to doha .

saeed pls read
to begin with , al in arabic means the and ilaah means god . in arabic the denite article the is a part of the word and is not a separate part of it as in english , so when putting the two words together al and ilaah we get the word allah or allaah which mean the god . the i , the rst letter of ilaah has been omitted to facilitate the pronunciation . note that the l in allaah is a dark one . now you must be wondering , what is the difference between the words allaah and allah , its simply a matter of spelling ; the spelling allah is more common , but in i-mag we adopt the spelling allaah as it represents the true pronunciation of the word in standard arabic . it is note worthy that there are two pronunciations of the word , one is a colloquial one to which the spelling allah might be more suitable , and a standard and more correct pronunciation that the spelling allaah best represent .

can i buy a car instead of renting ?
hello everybody , i will come to work in qatar for 1 year next month . i got a visit visa - one entry for one month and my company will renew it every month . so my question is : can i buy a used car instead of renting ? thank you in advance
re : can i buy a car instead of renting ?
i understand you will not have a residency permit ... rp that is ... without that you cant open a bank account ... the only way you can buy a used or a brand new car is to pay for it in cash since you wont be able to get a bank loan for that good luck
re : can i buy a car instead of renting ?
if you do get a residency permit , then you can open a bank account . if you 're goingto need an auto loan , the bank will only loan you money if your company or sponsor is on the `` approved list '' . if you 're not on their approved list , you 're not out of luck because mashreq bank and al khaliji bank will loan you money even if you 're not on the list . this is assuming you have a very good salary and some documentation to prove it . good luck !
re : can i buy a car instead of renting ?
but will he even be able to get a driver 's license without the rp ? from what i understand you can drive for a week or two with some countries ' drivers ' licenses but not longer . so he would n't be able to either rent or buy -LRB- register -RRB- the car . also , it 's illegal to work on a visit visa is n't it ? subject to arrest and deportation if caught ?
re : can i buy a car instead of renting ?
i have a friend that is trying to do the same as you . renting is expensive and if you buy a decent secondhand car you will have something to sell at the end of 12 months . my friend is here for 2 or 3 weeks every month and has been using a driver or renting a jeep at approximatley 5000-6000 qatar rials per month . i think you will need to get an international license or a short term qatar license every time you renew you visa . i think about 200 rials but not sure the problem is ownership of the car , you will need to register the car and also get insurance . i am not sure about these details . please if you find out any helpful details please contact me 6730727
re : can i buy a car instead of renting ?
i hope this does n't end up being a duplicate because i do n't yet see the 2nd answer i just submitted . anyway , first of all , a car rental agency will rent you a car if you do n't have a qatari dl . however , you will not be covered under any insurance umbrella . meaning , if you get into an accident you 're 100 % responsible for all repairs to the car up to the full prie of the car -LRB- unless it 's deemed the other drivers fault -RRB- . yes , it 's technically illegal to work on a tourist or visit visa , but some companies will let you slide if you 're in the process of applying for an rp . you wo n't be able to buy and register a vehicle without an rp if you 're trying for a bank loan . you wo n't even be able to open an account . banks wo n't lend money to anyone unless yuo 're on their `` approved list '' . however , mashreq bank and al khaliji will give you a loan if yuo 're not on the list provided you have a good income and can put 10 % down . even if you pay cash , i do n't think you can register or insure a new/used car without an rp .
re : can i buy a car instead of renting ?
i understand your position very well , but remember you can not process anything without a residence permit -LRB- rp -RRB- . when i say anything i mean it - bank account , driver 's licence , vehicle registration , etc. talk to your company and try to get a work permit and then an rp . failing which ask the company for an allowance for a regular taxi . there are many individuals providing personal taxi services - although there are measures to ban this practice . once again remember without an rp you can not process anything in qatar . and if you meet with an accident while driving without an rp the police ot the other party will simply put the blame on you .
re : can i buy a car instead of renting ?
why do n't you request then with your company to provide you one ... otherwise i would suggest that you should rent to avoid problem in future .
re : can i buy a car instead of renting ?
yes u can buy by cheap price i have a car i want to sell it now it 's maxima nissan 98 model u can come and see if u want call me 5173177

re : can husband block his wife 's exit from qatar ?

re : can husband block his wife 's exit from qatar ?
silver moon , y u want to runaway from ur husband ... ?? if any issues iamong u , plz sit around one table and sort out togother .
re : can husband block his wife 's exit from qatar ?
no and 100 no , he can not . any thing he has to go to court and make a case . he can not cancel your visa unless you make something against the law . if you are right then you can file divorce and change sponsor later and he can not do a damn thing.he can exit and come back any time you want . but if you exit and later he cancel your visa while you are outside the country then it is a problem beacuse you can not enter to file a case against him . make sure to solve everything before you leave .

re : can husband block his wife 's exit from qatar ?
blackcat ... r u married ? do you know the relationship between husband and wife ? when 2 fiends live for one week together they will have 100 problems but they solve and live again . and others will also help them to solve . but these two are living together and that husband has taken his wife to doha , there are enough people here who and not bothering abt wife or children and keeping other girls and living an illegal family life . without appreciating this husband for taking his wife and facing trouble why are u trying to spoil the life of two by giving these stupid advices . my sister . when it comes to family issues please do n't bring them to these type of community sites.cos there are are enough here to spoil ur family life.i do n't know what is the problem between u 2 . but remember all the problems comes to you cos of ur own mistakes . sit and think and discuss the issues with ur husband . in family life one should give up always.then only other will learn abt the giving up . m

there 's a government one near the airport somewhere , but i just want to say that the conditions there are horrible , and they do n't treat the animals very well either . and half the time , they 're not even there ! i always take my cats to the veterinary surgery . it 's expensive , but i guess it 's pretty much worth it . they do everything , spaying , vaccinations and all . www.dohavets.com is their website , if you want .

mafi w hotel ...
definitely bliss spa at w is too expensive and nothing compared to 4 seasons and ritz . the area is little , there is a small pull and not all the facilities such as steam room , sauna , jacuzzi and other lovely area . sorry for whom believe w is cool . it ' a just a building in the middle of the noise and sands . plus it 's much expensive the 4 season . that 4 me remain the best in doha . without any doubt . p.s. i just know the man areas ...

is ultrasound sonography is harmful for the baby ?
my wife is 38 weeks pregnent and has been going to hamad hospital since last 3 months.in hamad hospital doctors recommend an ultrasound after every 2 weeks.can any one tell me that is it harmful for the baby ? in india generally doctors do not prefer this much frequent ultrasound checkups.please suggest and share your experience .
re : is ultrasound sonography is harmful for the baby ?
as far as i know ultrasounds are not harmful as they use sound waves to see the baby and not radiation . my wife had one with almost every visit -LRB- we were in doha -RRB- but not every two weeks . but at least every month , some months more because we went to get second opinions .
re : is ultrasound sonography is harmful for the baby ?
i am following up with hamad hospital for 3 months and i am almost 21 weeks . usually they do the ultra sound once a month until the 32 -34 weeks when they start to do it every 2 weeks in order to make sure the mother and baby are healthy and knowing when the labor will start . i have asked that question and they ultra sound technician said that , if the pregnant lady did the ultra sound over 25 times during her first trimester it will be harmful for the baby . because the first trimester is when the development of the baby and his/her organs are developing . by the end of second trimester to the end of the third is only gain of weight and size . hope this helps www.bastook.com
re : is ultrasound sonography is harmful for the baby ?
no , at diagnostic level that too at later period of pregnancy it is safe.it is better to follow hamad hosp suggestion
re : is ultrasound sonography is harmful for the baby ?
there is no harm in doing frequent ultra sound test
re : is ultrasound sonography is harmful for the baby ?
u said she is in her 38 months so she is about to have the baby any time now . so it it is normal to check on the baby freqently.nothing wrong with that .
re : is ultrasound sonography is harmful for the baby ?
thanks to all of you.your answers have really made me feel better because this is our first baby and i was a little worried about that . once again thanks a lot ... ...
re : is ultrasound sonography is harmful for the baby ?
the less frequent the better . i had ultrasound every 2 weeks in my 1st trimester when i was expecting my youngest son . it is not recommended but i had a complicated pregnancy that was why . my son now 3,5 years old , healthy and happy . . thank god . eventhough i had the same worries you had . so , have a wonderfull parenthood .
re : is ultrasound sonography is harmful for the baby ?
i had ultrasound done every month when i was pregnant -LRB- that was during the time when i went to private clinic -RRB- then i switched to hamad hospital and i had three more in the last trimester of pregnancy.no complications just to make sure everything was ok with my baby .
re : is ultrasound sonography is harmful for the baby ?
at the begining stage of preganancy you have to go for ultrasound each and every -LRB- 03 -RRB- months , to make sure your baby is healthy and safe , if any complecation occured found by the doctor , they recommend for frequent ultrasound which is necessary ... - naeem -

health clubs with pools that are n't a rip off

hey mate , try oasis beach club . i am a member there . pool is pretty cool . gym is just alright . overall its good specially in terms of money . singles membership is subject to approval but it 's fine in most of the cases . however , if you do n't want permanent membership , there is an option to visit club on per day basis which is valid except weekends .
how are they priced
northernmagpie how are they priced ? also umk what is yearly cost for oasis ?
cigalle - qr2 ,000 for one
cigalle - qr2 ,000 for one month , qr8 ,000 for six ramada - qr1 ,500 for one months , qr4 ,500 for six these prices are nothing short of shocking . umk - oasis price ?
qr2800 per year qr50 or qr60
qr2800 per year qr50 or qr60 per day visits
oasis beach club
3500 per year for family + 500 registration for new membership

gps navigation
do any of you use a gps to get around in qatar ? if so , does it help or hurt more ? i was thinking of uploading the garmin middle east map but one person told me it 's irrelevant since streets are re-routed there often . just thought a navigator would make getting around a little easier when we first start driving but i do n't want to blow $ 120 on something useless either .

mobile phone gps
no need wasting your money for specific gps unit , all you need is just a mobile phone with gps capability . install it with garmin for mobile and complete the map of the area you need . or just used google maps if you do n't want get headache of renewal the maps . im using gps only to know where my position is and then figure out the fastest route because you know how often re-routing happened here in doha .
agree
happyhorizon ... too lazy ??? too tech savvy ????? or just too much money ??? :--RRB- . no offence intended . agree with darude . friday mornings are best to drive around in doha . most people do not get out of their homes until after lunch . the best way is to just drive around in squares . u will eventually reach your starting point . and yes , road works never end in doha . welcome and safe driving

my 8-yr . old son went up to me and asked `` mom , do you know israel ?

'' as a parent , how will you handle this ? i know israel is a big and delicate issue in middle east ...

kids will be kids , but its
kids will be kids , but its grown up 's who needs to be more responsible . my daughter goes to one of the leading international school in doha , where muslim children are in minority . when she told her friends about her trip to saudi arab in spring break , one of the kids told her not to go because the ppl are bad there . she took the matter to the teacher and he confirmed it for her by saying yes there are bad ppl in saudi . now as a teacher , it beats me how he could be so irresponsible . a grown up should not feed these hate thoughts to children . so i had to explain me 7 yr old how there are good and bad in every part of the world , and every religion , we just avoid bad ones and stick with good ones . i thought raising children in mulsim country will be eaiser for me , but i guess raising kids is not easy no matter where you are .
i 'd explain both sides - and
i 'd explain both sides - and that neither are right . it 's an opportunity to help teach him possibly about how to draw his own conclusions , when presented with all sides of an issue . i remember vividly my parents doing the same with me when it came to nuclear weapons -LRB- i was the only five year old who could tell you what hiroshima was and why it was bad - hippy parents -RRB- , the situation in rwanda in 1994 , apartheid , etc etc. the fact is this country does have a huge slant , and i think it 's important for anyone , kid or adult , to think critically about things .
also , it might be a good
also , it might be a good time to explain judaism anyway - it 's purim season and that 's a fun jewish holiday :-RRB- i mean , you ca n't avoid learning about islam here , may as well slot in the other religions too !

qatarisun
while agreeing in totality with your first post tell him when there is a war , everybody kills everybody . tell him the war is bad ! tell him everyone should live in peace i disagree with the second one . when there is a war people are killed . the bullet fired does not take care that victim belongs to which religion . i cant stress more . but let me tell you that i believe in taking consideration of roots problem rather than just consequences thereof . zionist israel is responsible for the present crisis thats all ! and if you kill someone expect same reaction from other end .
advocate when you were at
advocate when you were at school did you ever have to do a debate on a subject you did n't like ? i think it is good if schools do this as it forces you to look at other peoples values , and just because you think they are silly , etc they are still their values and how you can more effectively have a dialogue .
this happened with me , too --
my son was playing with some neighborhood kids and they had said to him that israeli planes were going to drop bombs on everyone and that they kill people when they find them ... got him really wound up and scared . so i explained to him that the other kids were muslim , and they they believed certain things that we did n't necessarily believe in . they do n't they do n't eat pork , we do ; we believe in santa , they do n't ; etc. i then went on to explain about how some countries fight and go to war with one another and people get hurt and killed and it 's never nice , but it happens . and hopefully soldiers try to be as careful as they can , but sometimes women and kids and old people and animals get hurt and killed by accident . it 's sad but it happens . and then i explained that some of our best family friends are jewish and/or israelis , and i asked if he knew that -LRB- no , he did n't -RRB- , and then i said that i did n't think that our friends were bad people at all -LRB- he agreed -RRB- , and so i did n't think it was fair for people to say that all israelis were bad . that there were good and bad people everywhere , all over the world . he kind of got the idea ... but it is tough raising kids here ... and i know i am going to have to constantly fight this battle , because he will hear it from kids every single year -- on the playground , in class , everywhere . btw , we had to do this song-and-dance on another controversial issue : homosexuality . my son came home one day and announced that when a man loves another man and gets married to him , it 's `` haram '' -LRB- lol -- he did n't even know what that word meant ! -RRB- . so off i went on my soapbox , trying to explain to him my point of view that there is nothing wrong with any two adults who love one another ... and that when he grows up , he can decide for himself what he thinks is right and wrong about a lot of things . and that in the meantime , he will hear a lot of different ideas , but that does n't necessarily make any of them correct or mean that he has to agree with them , even with ideas that i subscribe to . whew ! it 's tough being a parent !!
@grand . .
would n't that be biased ?
it is difficult
but i do like the way umm handled it . i have a friend , she is from england her husband from lebanon . her son when it was coming up to national day told her that in no way was he going to have anything to do with lebanon because his friends did not like arabs . this boys goes to one of the ` supposed ' best schools in doha . i told my friend , that if that was my kid , they would have gone to school with a cedar strapped to their hand , some lebanese food and union jack underpants . my thoughts are my own , but i doubt my mum would agree with some of them .
to ummjake . .
that was nice ... i admire you that you have shown your son the two other sides of the coin ... yes , it 's really tough raising our kids here . .
thats wonderful because a
thats wonderful because a young child 's mind needs to be moulded into a proper one and the circumstances and environment he lives in is a major factor in that . i would make sure that he remains as neutral as possible and when he grows up , then he can take sides
i think i might try to
i think i might try to defuse the specifics of the question and focus on `` what is war . '' explain why war is wrong and use the example of children being killed as a reason why we must all work to bring about peace . that way you do n't have to take sides in a we/they , israel/lebanon discussion at this point . mandi
totally agree with you

you have to tell your
you have to tell your kid : never never blame the people and the country . the war - it 's political issues and government responsibilities . jewish people are kind , religious and the most educated people in the world . they do n't kill babies . the government does . one government provokes , the other replies . never never teach you kids to hate just people !!! jewish , lebanese , palestinians , americans babies are cute and sweet and all jewish , lebanese , palestinians , americans mothers and fathers love their children !!!

israel is a terrorist regime
i agree with ummjake
i think that politicians on both sides are responsible for civilian victims on both sides . i ca n't deceive myself and others by blaming israel only because i am a muslim or an arab
i am amazed by your reply
ummjake , i am really surprised by your arguments trying to explain to your son things that he knows better than you . while i would pass on the israeli vs arab -LRB- muslim -RRB- issue because it is contravertial , and i do n't want to be biase , i am stunned by your answers/arguments about gays . your son has the correct info , and i am certain you know that as well . just your freek education and being politically correct prevent you from saying the truth . if you are a christian or a jewsih , you know that the bible or old testement do not approve of this . if you do n't have a religion , you know that human nature does reject such a relationship . your kid is being tought the correct things at school , while you are manipulating them ...
okabbar ... to each his own ...
why does it bother you -LRB- or anyone else really -RRB- what two consenting adults choose to do with their private romantic/sexual lives ? they 're not asking you to join in . just be happy they have found someone to love and care for . and human nature does not reject such a relationships . statistics show that 10 % of the population are homosexual . there 's even evidence of homosexuality being the norm in some parts of the animal kingdom . do your homework ... my kid is n't being taught this in school . trust me . if he were , i would yank him out of there so fast your head would spin . he 's hearing about it from the other kids in the neighborhood , who hear it from their parents , who subscribe to that notion because their religion dictates it and that 's what they 've been brought up on . if that lifestyle is not for you , then do n't follow it . simple enough . let everyone make their own choices about what works for them . think you can handle that ?

first , thank you for taking the debate with a good spirit . by the way , currently , i live in us , and probably moving to qatar inthe next 2-months or so . the two of us and the lady who started this thread are going through the same thing in a different spirit . while i am trying to move to qatar to protect my kids form the type of education and tolerance the west promot -LRB- and obviously you do as well -RRB- , you are trying to protect your kids from the good morals that the society in qa breatch . i am an educated person with a phd degree , and very open to tolerate many issues , but nothing againist the human nature or the order of god . while i was so accomodating to avoid the debate about israel -LRB- i am an arab by the way -RRB- , i would not tolerate the gays lesbian issue . good created us to multiply , otherwise , if two men get married and two women get married , and the human raise will disappear . it is immoral issue , and disgusting behaviour . it is not a matter of why i am bothered by this , it is a matter of moral and religion belive . the three main relgion do disapprove of this . you know the story of the people of prophet loat -LRB- sp ! -RRB- , how good punished them . the story is mentioned in the three holy books . i would certainly argue againist the animal kingdoom ? i have never read , heard , or seen that animals do practice this . males animals always fight for feamales . any culture and society has positives and negatives , and the smart person who try to improve on his qualities . i have been in na for 18 years , and picked up many of the good qualities that are hear , such as educations , work ethics , honesty , dedications , tolearnce , objectivity , being profissional in all aspect of your life , time keeping , etc. i hope you can be prave enough , and pick on some of the good ethics and morals down there in qatar , beside the money ...

you 'll probably encounter gays in doha more than any other place .
very articulate ummjake
well expressed , ummjake . if my son came home spouting stuff about homosexuality being ` haram ' i would certainly object to it strongly too . the fact of homosexuality being found in the animal kingdom is indeed well documented . there are cases of ` gay ' animals being found in some colonies . it is -LRB- humourously -RRB- called the ` science that dares not speak its name ' . i do recall an interesting documentary on showtime -LRB- the arab world satellite network -RRB- about this not long ago . what this fact of nature indicates that it is not the ` unnatural ' behaviour moralists have always claimed it to be , since given a free reign , even animals engage in it naturally . human - and animal - sexuality is so much more complex than just the ` man and woman . . they make baby ' narrative which religionists are have been using for centuries . and homosexuality being condemned in the christianity and judaism ? hmm , you may want to check your facts on that one . sure , the vatican do n't like it , but there is a lot of scholarship to explain why the anti-gay interpretation gained traction over history - gained traction until it was considered a `` fact '' - but was , in fact , not correct . understanding the nature of religion as a way of leveraging power over others really helps to explain why we follow its rituals and ideas with such dedication , even flying in the face of logic , science , or reason . ------------- `` let 's slip out of these wet clothes and into a dry martini '' mae west

although i respect ummjack
although i respect ummjack opinion . but i would never teach my son to accept gays . i 'll never teach him either to fear or reject them . it 's up to him to determine it himself . both my parents share `` arab nationalist '' ideology.yet , i 've never been taught to hate jews .
with my children
i always , always say there are good and bad in every race , religion and country . respect has to be given to all . i am very old fashioned , my boys always stand up when any lady enters the room . they hold doors open for both men and women , simply because that shows respect and good manners to an adult . if an adult is rude to them after they have shown them respect , all i say is , they could have been having a bad day -LRB- whilst fuming -RRB- . my thoughts are my own , but i doubt my mum would agree with some of them .

i never do always have a variety of sources , weigh the evidence , it 's authenticity and provenience then make up my own mind . <span style="font-style: italic"> `` deaths in the bible . god - 2,270,365 not including the victims of noah 's flood , sodom and gomorrah , or the many plagues , famines , fiery serpents , etc because no specific numbers were given . satan - 10 .

i too agree that what read in the press or see on the ` news ' has to be taken with a pinch of salt . however , how do people learn ? i admit that people are travelling more and so they see for themselves but we have to read and then debate and then make our own conclusions . my thoughts are my own , but i doubt my mum would agree with some of them .
israel
thanks all for a high quality debate . i think we can both learn from hearing the other side . i want to take up for the israel argument from the perspective of another arab -LRB- in this case palestinian -RRB- who has lived over half his life in the us and england . its true that in the middle east there is a culture of black and white . however , in the west , there is a culture of gray . in other words , there is a tendency to say both sides are at fault and there is no hard facts and no right and wrong . sometimes this is true , but in my opinion often it allows one to have a lazy psuedo-intellectual opinion about a subject they know very little about . it takes knowledge to take a -LRB- fair -RRB- stand . there is little remaining grayness in the israel palestine issue . this is a situation where one people came and displaced another , and continue to abuse them for over 50 years . israeli historians and most israeli intellectuals agree with these facts . look up benny morris and the new historians in israel for the modern scholarly israeli narrative for what happened in palestine . its not pretty . israel is in defiance of nearly 100 un resolutions , relating both to their land grab and human rights records . the closest analogy is the displacement of the native indians in north america -- i am sure it would sound shocking if you try to assign them some of the blame for the genocide they experienced . the other side tries to feebly resist , but are subjected to an overwhelming opression and injustice ; the closest anology to the current situation on the ground is aparthide in south africa . nowadays , the arab countries have made remarkable compromise articulated in the saudi initiative more than 5 years ago . they are agreeing to complete normalization with israel , in exchange for the west bank -LRB- 21 % of the area of the historical palestine which had less than 5 % jews 100 years ago -RRB- . however , israeli right wing , with the support of the israeli lobbies the us -LRB- aipac and jdl and their cronies -RRB- insist on no compromise . meanwhile , over 2 million palestinians continue to live in subhuman conditions and the world continues to find `` both sides at blame '' because they will not agree to it . we live in strange times . i hope that you would instead encourage your kids to read and figure out the facts ; isnt that a great lesson ? i am a strong believer that with justice , comes peace , and the festering wounds that generate hate are dried up . i also sincerely hope that you invest a little more energy into learning about the middle east geo-political issues before assuming that you know about it than the people living it do .
joi_de_vivre
it 's not about the conflict . . the question was : how to handle the question of 8 years-old boy about `` israelians killing lebanese babies '' . you suggest studding israelian-palestin conflict and figuring out who is ` good ' and who is ` bad ' , which consequentially leads to accepting one side and judging another , which eventually leads to the stirring up the hatred . but thats not what the child needs . not to find out who is right and who is wrong , not to argue anymore when , who , and why ? child needs to be explained that any killing is bad , any war is wrong . child doesnt need to understand why one kills another . child has to learn : any killing shouldnt be accepted in the civil world . i hope you can see the difference . <i> <b> ********************* you become responsible forever for what you have tamed . antoine de saint-exupry </b> </i> <img src="http://cdnll.img1.imagechef.com/w/080610/anmd46ebbf9c8c024ef.gif">
i completely agree and see
i completely agree and see the difference . i was not offering any advice about how to handle the situation of the original poster . i struggle with these issues with my own sons , who are 5 and 3 . i was attempting to generate an adult discussion similar to the one above on homosexuality . cheers .
joi_de_vivre : but honestly , what parent is going to
not tell their kids something they believe is true `` because it has not been well-researched '' ? -LRB- and who is deciding whether something is well-researched or not ? -RRB- nobody would do that . i think the most open-minded of parents might try to explain both sides and then tell their kids that as they grow up and learn more , they will make up their own minds , but we will almost always explain what we believe is true ... because when you believe something yourself , you generally think that you are right . that 's just human nature . i seriously doubt that the religious among us would tell their kids `` well , mommy and i believe in one god , and that he created the heavens and the earth . but that 's just us . you should read up on the subject and find out what makes sense to you . '' lol ! but would n't it be fun if they did ?
ummjake ...
kudos to you for teaching your children that what is taught and said in school is n't the gospel truth ! children are confused enough as it is in life without being taught that certain nationalities , races , religions , sexual orientation , are the devil incarnate . children 's minds are like blank blackboards ... they also absorb things like sponges . why teach them hatred against others at such a young impressionable age when all they want to do is be friends with the next child , irregardless of who or where they are from ? life is difficult enough to deal with , without presetting young minds upon a destructive path . if you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous , he will not bite you ; that is the main difference between a dog and man . - mark twain -

if i am from the usa then i should have the same opinion as you ? i say clearly i am a palestinian who has lived in the us over half his life . i am a us citizen . i am a long term lurker on qatarliving who registered to contribute to this conversation . i am a professor in a us university on sabbatical leave for the year in qatar -- what does this have to do with anything , anyways ? my response was intended to generate adult conversation . the crux of my argument is that many expats here do not understand the geopolitical situation in israel/palestine and assume instead that people here are irrational for having the opinion that they do about israel . a peaceful and just resolution to the problem there is the only way to stop the hate ; that starts with understanding the facts on the ground , instead of having the pc opinion that there are no facts and everyone there is equally to blame . my response was not intended in any way to be something you say to your kids -- poor choice of thread on my part .
ummjake
i completely agree with your sentiment and respect the way you are raising your kids . i apologize if my response came across as if i am being critical of you . i like the emphasis on growing up and learning more for issues that are too complex for them to handle ; i will use that line with my own kids if you dont mind . peace -LRB- and justice ! -RRB-
joi_de_vivre , i took no offense at your postings
and have no problem with your nationality , heritage or where you choose to live or work . i agree -- a lot of these issues present wonderful teaching moments if you 've got kids . but as parents we have to view them as such and be mindful of what we say , how we say it , and whether our actions match our words ... as robert fulghum said , `` do n't worry that children never listen to you ; worry that they are always watching you . ''
okabbar , welcome to doha if
okabbar , welcome to doha if indeed you decide to come . there is a lot of benefit to raising children here , especially kids from north america who have tended to see themselves as the center of the known universe ! but one caveat for you , i have known many parents with fine moral fiber get the shock of their lives when they tumble to the fact that their kids are mistreating their maids , shopkeepers or other laborers whom they happen to come in contact with . i 'm not saying everyone and i know that every parent says not my kid , but i 've known a lot of surprised and dismayed parents . mandi

thanks mandilulur
thanks for the greetings . i do n't know how much you know about canada and its culture and education . canada and canadian system is one of a kind when it comes to social integration , respecting others , and peaceful interactions . to make the story short , i have three boys -LRB- 10 , 7 , and 2 -RRB- , and they are so respectable to others and so peaceful . to a a degree , where i am a bit annoyed about it . i am struggling to teach my kids to be aggressive when there is a need for it . they always resort to peaceful ways in resovling any conflicts or aggression committed against them at school . the are so obedient to rules and polices . i want them to be street wise , and when things turns rough , they can handle it . so may be they will gain some of this by moving to doha !! i hope you understand my point , i am not an agressive or agressor , but boys -LRB- future men -RRB- they need to be tought to stand up for themselves if there is a need for it . us culture is totally different , and it is more in the aggressive side compared to canada . currently i work in us -LRB- since june 08 -RRB- , but i did not move my family yet . i am in a cross road , where i need to decide once and for all if i am going to move to arabic country or settle for ever in na . giving my kids the opportunity to be fluent in arabic and experince islamic/arabic culture and true religious feastivities have been playing in my mind for few years . it is vefry difficult to hear my kids speek arabic in a funny way/tone .
wooo ... i guess the
wooo ... i guess the political and religious threads are the strongest magnets in this community . my answer to the original question ... i would tell my child that she ca n't hate a group of people based on what `` some '' of them do ... if your colleague at school is nice to you ... be more nice to her/him regardless of what her nationality or regligion is . if she buys you a gift on your birthday ... be sure to save her birthday date on your calender and do n't forget to buy her a great gift . do not hate anyone unless you try and try and try and try to communicate your hurt to them ... tell them why you feel hurt by what they do and why their actions are keeping you from loving them . war is an ugly thing . no baby deserves to die in return for a woman who got killed by a bomber ... and vice versa . in the end , different people are influenced by the cultures they are raised in ... and from these cultures they conclude their own opinions about different topics in life ... war , sex , education , work , religion ... etc. . the best thing to do is to try to strip your mind off any biased ideas and prejedice against any group of people . jews and israelis are very much unwelcommed and hated in the middle east ... because people hear and see everyday from the media what israelis do to their brothers and sisters . in the western communities ... muslims are also unwelcommed and hated ... because people there see and hear from the media what muslims do around the world . if you stand up for something ... you will have to prove you are right ... and you will have to suffer the consequences and responsibilities for your beleifes . in the end ... i would tell my daughter to refer to the quran ... it explain best all what i ` have just said .

crying is a natural reaction ...
a natural defense mechanism of the human body regardless of sex -LRB- male or female -RRB- ... although most men and women as well , thought of crying as a sign of weakness . saying `` only ladies cry . '' but for me a man who cries is a man who knows himself throughly ... he understands very well that crying is a natural reaction . . and doing such can not or will never diminish his sexuality or manliness . he only wants to feel better after every crying ... thus affirming his humanity . by the way , animals do n't cry ... they go on rage . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = when in rome do as the romans do !!!

mr m , come on ... shedding some tears is crying too !!! and it 's good to know that women are the cause lol ... listen to the sound of silence ...
tears have healing powers ...
it 's okay to cry ... real men should not be afraid to cry ... men who cry are confident with themselves that they are true men who are brave to accept their weakness ... who understand that breaking down or crying is not a sign of being sissies rather it is a natural human emotion that everyone has to go through . i have read somewhere that the percentage of breakdowns / suicides are higher in males than females ... females have the capacity to handle problems/situations because aside from friends and families who give them moral support , their tears give way to bottled up emotions ... once they have a good cry , they feel better and relieved .

pc one
pc one do n't carry enough components , you spec the machine on the alienware site , then take that spec to the . they arrange to import of the machine from states , shipping , customes etc. . the shop outside the sofitel that bleu might be refering to is around the back , away from the main road , gigabyte i think , and that is the brand they stock , had a lot of over priced liquid cooled cases last time i looked .

can i import a car from uae ?
what are the procedures to buy a car from uae and bring it over here to register it in qatar if possible ? is it a big headach ? what i should pay as costumes or anything else ? thanks in advance .
re : can i import a car from uae ?
of course you can bring it but beware ! a new car bought in uae will probably not be serviced by the main dealer here under warranty . a friend tried to import an old car and they would n't let it in , cost almost 100,000 qr in port charges , before it was resolved . you have the added complication of driving through saudi if coming overland . check everything before you try this .
re : can i import a car from uae ?
hey johnboy , is that true ? five years old ? i was told it is now 3 years old . i have a similar problem . i want to import my car ; however , it is 5 years old .
re : can i import a car from uae ?
hi i think poeple are gauding u wrong . upon my information if the person is already in uae and he migrate on new visa -LRB- work permet -RRB- and he wana brought his car along with him . so i think without any cost he will bring it . because i been in saudi once for purpose of ummra over there , and my cousine is in riyadh so he wana buy my car . so when i back to doha , i ask on my sources so i got that i m not able .

any idea of car rates ??
hi any idea , how much a brand new 1st end car will cost me and if i am taking a loan , how much i have to pay per month to the bank ? m planning 2 buy either honda crv or nissan murano .
oh my , did n't think of that .
oh my , did n't think of that . surely 2 hours is way too much time to spend on buying a car .
you have to pay atleast
you have to pay atleast 10,000 qr more if you buy car over loan . the loan also depends on you salary . the bank will cut min . 1500qr per month and that also depends on how many years you want to pay loan , 3/5 . better contact with any showroom person .
car loan rates
car loan rates are usually `` flat '' the average/normal bank rates are between 4.5 to 6 % -LRB- promos excluded -RRB- so if you are buying a car -LRB- eg . crv - qar .100,000 / - -RRB- on a 5 year loan @ 5 % ; add 2.5 % - 3 % processing fee + 25 % interest + first year insurance say 5 % ... your total to pay bank is 100,000 +2500 +25000 +5000 i.e. , 132,000 therefore monthly instalment would be 132,000 / 60 = qar .2,208 / - and it could vary slightly depending on the grace period you choose or bank offers for the first repayment . you can get the same terms from car dealer 's inhouse financing -LRB- if bankloan doesnt work -RRB- but the rate could be 7.5-8 .5 % good luck

car loan if you move company ...
no , you can change jobs within qatar , your new company will provide a letter so you can keep the loan at repayment agreed originally . i am leaving qatar soon and am going to transfer the bank loan i have for my car to the next buyer as long as they are eligable for the loan . you can do this no problem . i have a toureg v8 if you are interested : -RRB-

is any legal problem for driving the car of other person
i heard there is rule in qatar one person can not drive the car of other person -LRB- other than his sponsor -RRB- . is it true ? pls let me know thanks in advance
re : is any legal problem for driving the car of other ...
no problem at all ... you just have to present an ownership id if and when the police requires you to do so ... just be safe and prevent accidents
re : is any legal problem for driving the car of other ...
i too am interested in this . if my friend lends me his car and i have a valid licence , does his car insurance automatically cover me to drive ? in the uk cars are insured under the name of the driver and if you want anyone else to drive it you have to put their name on the policy . is that the same here ?
re : is any legal problem for driving the car of other ...
as far as i understand it , it is the car that is insured not the driver . so as long as you have a valid driving licence , qatari or otherwise you are insured to drive the vehicle .
re : is any legal problem for driving the car of other ...
yes , no problem you can drive other people 's car anytime as long as you did not hit something or worst someone . cheers ,

re : can i leave qatar without id
better ask the authorities . a friend of mine was issued a residence permit about 3 weeks back , he has the id , and he got exit permit from his company . all was set for a planned trip to dubai , but , was he aghast when the airline would not let him board . apparently your visa needs to be at least 6 months old before you are granted exit . well , at least to gcc , though im not very sure , perhaps to home country is fine . but otherwise , i think you 're in detention . should be worth it to check with the right people just to save you the hassle .

1 . rajnikanth taught chuck norris how to deliver roundhouse kicks . 2 . rajnikanth once roundhouse kicked a tata truck in chennai . it became the tata nano and fell on mamata banerjees head in kolkata . 3 . rajinikanth reverses court judgements by making the ink run back into the judges ballpen . 4 . rajinikanth once boarded a virgin atlantic flight from chennai to new york . the stewards served the tea cold . so when the flight finally touched down , it was just atlantic . 5 . matrix was originally planned in tamil as with rajinikanth as rajinikanth . but the bullets were so shit scared that they pissed in the barrels and refused to come out of the guns in his presence . 6 . rajinikanth once went to jim corbett national park . after eight straight hours of snapping pictures , the tired tigers ran out of camera film . 7 . rajinikanth doesnt need to sleep with a gun under his pillow . he is deadlier with the pillow . 8 . the movie 300 was initially planned to be made with rajinikanth . it was originally named 1 . 9 . rajinikanth is so flexible , he can lick his elbow . 10 . hes also so smart , he knows youd try to do it after reading that . 11 . raincoats were developed to prevent raindrops from getting electrocuted on coming within 1oo metres of rajinikanth . 12 . rajinikanth has successfully reversed global warming . all the glaciers just froze when they heard his name . 13 . rajinikanth once dived into the sea from his chennai condo . the next thing you know is that a tsunami has hit half the world . 14 . the chennai delhi rajdhani express once missed rajinikanth . it ran as fast as it could but failed to catch him . 15 . rajinikanth can kill a 100 villains at a time just with his dialogues . 16 . viagra often needs rajinikanth . 17 . newton gave us just the three dumb laws of motion . rajinikanth has already given us 33,945 laws of commotion andthe count is far from completed . 18 . no one messes with rajinikanth . only rajinikanth can mess with himself . 19 . sunny deol once thrashed a battalion of pakistanis with his bare hands . rajinikanth can thrash 1000 such sunny deols with his bare tongue . 20 . parachutes were invented just to prevent the earth from getting shattered to pieces when hit by a falling rajinikanth . 21 . only two things on earth are visible from space . rajinikanth in his mundu and some wall in africa . or is that in china ? 22 . what colour is rajinikanths blood ? haha ! trick question ! rajinikanth never bleeds !! 23 . rajinikanth is faster than email . he is now officially the second fastest thing in the universe after mms . 24 . rajinikanth uses pepper spray as eye drops . 25 . man proposes ; rajinikanth disposes . and disposes fast

re : how does a spouse work for themselves legally in qatar ?
it is quite common here in qatar , running private tution classes , music classes , musical instruments training , baby sitting at home etc. etc. . for this case you can do it at home unless someone run out from your building after hear your song !! , when group of children gather together to learn music , and sing together make sure it will not disturb your neighbors and they complain , i love music , i love songs , i use to sing but a not professional singer .

where can i buy vga to hdmi cable ??
where can i buy vga to hdmi cable ?? how much ?? thanks
re : where can i buy vga to hdmi cable ??
you can get dvi to hdmi any where i have seen in lulu d ring . not sure about vga to hdmi
re : where can i buy vga to hdmi cable ??
how many do you need ? i 'll ask my techie friend if he have one .
re : where can i buy vga to hdmi cable ??
do n't think you will get a vga to hdmi cable . you would need an adapter to convert the signals . vga is analogous signal and hdmi is digital . i have n't seen a direct vga to hdmi adapter around here . you can always get a vga to dvi adapter from any computer shop and dvi to hdmi cable from any electronics shop . but be aware that this will only give you a video signal , no audio .
re : where can i buy vga to hdmi cable ??
you can check carrefour or technical care center . . both in city center mall

re : gcc driving license
you ca n't drive in egypt with your qatari driving liciense . you need to first get an international driving license here in qatar and then you can drive there in egypt with your international driving license .

re : gcc driving license
qatar driving license general qatari residents must carry a valid qatari driving licence . ggc state nationals are permitted to use their national driving licenses . as a visitor -LRB- other nationals -RRB- to qatar , your national driving licence is acceptable for seven days from your date of arrival in the country . if you wish to rent a car for longer than the seven days -LRB- but do not intend to take up permanent residence -RRB- you will require a temporary driving license . if you are keen to drive during your first few months in qatar , it is worth obtaining an international licence before you get here . an international driving license is valid for 6 months from the date of your arrival in qatar . getting a driving license depends on what country you are from . citizens from most western countries such as canada and the u.k. can change their drving licenses for qatari ones . other nationalities have to do a driving test which is actually quite difficult . in most cases the procedure for issuing a local licence just includes an eye test and a simple written test . however , it is necessary to hold a residence permit in order to apply for a qatari driving licence . the procedure temporary driving license the following items are required for a temporary driver 's license -LRB- tdl -RRB- : a -RRB- original drivers license from home country . b -RRB- eye examination . c -RRB- process fees qr156 -LRB- about $ 45 -RRB- . d -RRB- four personal photos -LRB- with eye glasses , if required -RRB- . e -RRB- copy of passport an appointment for the eye examination will be set up for you by the hr department and you will be informed of the time and date for the appointment . permanent drivers license converting the temporary driver 's license to a permanent driver 's license requires the following : a -RRB- temporary drivers license -LRB- tdl -RRB- . b -RRB- two photos . c -RRB- copy of passport and residence permit . d -RRB- process fees of qr156 -LRB- about $ 45 -RRB- .

90 % white cars ... ????
pardon my ignorance ... new to the gulf ... just wondering why 90 % plus cars are white in color ? ... does it have something to do with the climate -LRB- 'cause white color absorbs less heat ... -RRB- ... or some other reason . . ?
re : 90 % white cars ... ????
i think yes because white color absorb less heat !!
re : 90 % white cars ... ????
atleast want to believe that it 's one way of preventing accident with other vehicle since white is very visible .
re : 90 % white cars ... ????
and with all the dust/sand , it does n't show as much as it would on a darker colour
re : 90 % white cars ... ????
1 . agreed that white reflects heat , but i doubt that it will do much effect on the car as the body is metal and its a conductor . 2 . dust does n't show much on a white car . 3 . easier to touch up white than any other shade of a color . 4 . it has evolved into a choice now . people just go for white cars ! i went to one showroom once and they said they order for 50 % white cars and the rest 50 % other colors .
re : 90 % white cars ... ????
there are much reasons about it . first one is that arabic peoples like white color ... 2nd is about heat . . 3rd dust . . and so on
re : 90 % white cars ... ????
white is coooooooooooooooooool in cars buddy ? aint it ???
re : 90 % white cars ... ????
becoz `` white the best ''
re : 90 % white cars ... ????
white is cool , looks good easy on cleaning always looks new with less manintaince.safe in night even from long distance so natuarally people prefer white.may be your first car here will be white too : -RRB-
trekking equipment
hi , i am planning a hiking trip in the himalayas for next month . is there any shop in doha where i can suitable trekking gear -LRB- e.g. winter sleeping bag , fleece , trekking pants , ect . -RRB- ? regards
karni
sleeping bags that you buy here wont work there coz its winter season in the himalayan region and you need small , and light sleeping bags that can withstand temperatures upto -10 degree celcius or more .
i bought a back pack from
i bought a back pack from souq asiri for 180 riyals . held everything that i needed . bought a sleeping bag from city centre for 65qr and the moment i used it , i started regretting my decision . i was still dead freezing . i am paralysed from one lower limb , so i had to carry what i was able to carry and most of the time the stuff i took with me thinking that i might need it sometime later on was not even used . so the next time i go , i will just take myself and some extra cash with me as everything is available wherever you go . i went to pakistan to the karakoram and crossed over to china . the best trip of my life and i will be going back again . visit hunza in pakistan and karakul lake in china when you go there and make your way to east to tibet . its amazing .
you can try sport shops at city center
i do not remember the name exactly but there is a shop at 3rd floor i think . you can find pants , bags , shoes and such stuff there . they sell nice stuff like columbia , titanium , etc. . but its hard to find sizes sometimes . the shop is beside timberland . `` what does n't kill me ; makes me stronger ... ''
i doubt you will find what
i doubt you will find what are you looking for . sleeping bags are available but you might need to have at least 3 season for winter hike . trekking sticks and some good stuff is available in the new sports shop in villagio , near food courts . expensive shop but some good stuff is there . if you are not able to find good clothing , go with the layers . the best thing -LRB- if you can find -RRB- is breathable wind breaker/rain jacket .
back pack
`` make a difference or make way '' should you need heavy duty back packs i got two brand new on sale . the north face from usa
falling for the looks
well it always seems so shallow that we always fell for good looks and the good nature of the person only follows it lately but what can we do ... it is how the mother nature has made us !!!!!!!!

resale of a kia versus nissan
thanks for earlier responses . does a nissan have better resale than kia ?
re : resale of a kia versus nissan
yap nissan sunny 2001 price 19000qr
re : resale of a kia versus nissan
yes , you are right !! nissan have better resale than kia
re : resale of a kia versus nissan
well , i would go for neither of them , as both of those companies have low resale values . it is true that nissan has higher resale value than kia , but both of them have low . as someone said , that a car does n't matter as long as you like it , but you also need to look after the resale value . the two companies with the highest resale value are honda and toyota . i would recommend these 2 out of all .

check if your bottled water

gps works exceptionally well in desert countries like the gulf as there is very less tree cover . desert storm was a gps war ... lol you can not lose your way even in low visiblity times like sand stroms etc. . while in places with very dense tree cover , gps signal is interrupted ... its definitely a problem in kerala ... because of so much coconut and other tree cover . gps war would prove ineffective there ... lol most of the phones have 2 modes of connection : 1 . assisted gps will use cell site to connect , quick connect , but it has charges . this is usless in places where there is no cell-site like sealine ... etc. i suggest to switch it off unless you literally can not get a gps signal even after 15minutes . 2 . integrated gps uses the true satellite signal to connect . it takes about 1 to 3 minutes to find a minimum of 3 satellites , depending on where you stand . it can not function without reaching 3 or 4 satellites . advantages of phones over stand alone sat nav units are : 1 . you carry the phone everywhere ... chances of forgeting it are next to zero . 2 . you can send your coordinates as mms so someone comming to meet you in a remote place ... say you are meeting a group in the desert . 3 . convenience ... it has everything in a single unit ... especially the camera . 4 . its dirt cheap if you split the cost as below : -LRB- a -RRB- phone , -LRB- b -RRB- camera , -LRB- c -RRB- music/video player -LRB- d -RRB- camera -LRB- e -RRB- gps <b> best gps mobile is samsung omnia qr 1850 </b> -LRB- carrefour -RRB- 8gb card , 5mp camera , excellent wifi , due to windows os , touch screen , garmin xt mobile gps software ,
dear friend i want know.what are the coast of ramadan shahry ?
does any cne know about shary qtel cost of ramadan offers ?
...
i have an iphone 3gs . both the gps and maps are just fine . i can pinpoint my location even inside the office .
neahhh
c'mon guys ! comment on something that is useful . @jailbroken114 , for you it works perfectly because your 're connected to your office 's wireless network , so the iphone can download the maps live from the net . give it a try and go to mesaeed in the desert and you will see that you will still have gps -LRB- free all over the world - global positioning system -RRB- signal but no map . so , how can you navigate back to safety during a sand storm for example . nor qtel or vodafone offer 3g support for iphone , hence you have no internet , hence you have no map . hence - you ca n't call that navigation , right ?
try the iphone 3gs before you talk
my experience is excellent using cygic and google maps and the built in maps app preloaded into the iphone . tried it and tested it to work perfectly with cygic you do n't need the internet connection . to pre register from my 1st hand experience .
yup i think it would work
yup i think it would work fine anywhere , even in the loo . but it wo n't be able to determine the exact precise location of yours , maybe within a few 100 metres would do . `` everything is okay in the end , if it 's not ok , then it 's not the end . '' `` when one door closes , another opens ; but we often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door that we do not see the one that has opened for us . ''
gps navigation with iphone 3g/3gs
i found out a great solution . . alternative to tom tom and garmin . . workz with charm in my iphone 3g much beter and with routing and turn by turn voice help . . much much better than garmin . . checkout my post on the forum topic in section `` advice and help '' . .

hi there . is it safe to work there ? for women as well ? kindergardens for expats ? is anyone looking strange at
hi there . is it safe to work there ? for women as well ? kindergardens for expats kids available ? is anyone looking strange at you at shopping and on the street?cheers.mihai
re : hi there . is it safe to work there ? for women as well ...
it 's safer than australia for both men and women . there are lots of kindergartens , just do n't procrastinate finding one and getting acceptance . and yes , be prepared to be stared at constantly . either just stare back or ignore it .
re : hi there . is it safe to work there ? for women as well ...
in the middle east this is the safest place and void of any public indecency as in dubai or baharain .
re : hi there . is it safe to work there ? for women as well ...
do n't worry , this is a safe country ... being stared constantly is just a normal thing here . also , better to have a car when you 're here than commuting ... not only to avoid the stares but also the b.o of other passengers :-LRB- ewwwwww !!!!
re : hi there . is it safe to work there ? for women as well ...
women stare just as much as men , particularly at western people . apart from the rudeness i encounter from other women occasionally , and the competition to have had the most babies , i do n't find living here a problem .
re : hi there . is it safe to work there ? for women as well ...
it is safe but i was a working mum and i found these diffciulties ... i had a business visa and could not sponsor a nnanny therefore i was left with maids who had company visas and or were illegal or not experienced but immediately looking foir the next jobs . i tested three but found none to satisfactory - my children were 2 and 4 so i kept them home as the fees for school a driver and the time the kids would have to get up were crazy i had a one hour commute each way so my days was wasted driving not with my kids . the nearest park to my home could be reached by car only , and the traffic sometimes made it a two hour exercise just in driving . the hospitals were ok but the public ones were accessible for appointments during work hours and the private ones expensive . i had a contract that allowed no unpaid leave and had penalties for missed work even if your kids were sick . needless to say when my husabnd wanted to return home and resume his work and i had been unable to hire help and my son had an epileptic seizure - i gave notice and came home . as an expatriate worker with family i have found much friendly countries to work in where larger percentages of your pay stay with you and are not absorbed by high rents school fees and food prices . you need a good salary if you want to do all you want . in your contract get a vila provided and education for kids and a vihicle rent allowance and you can have an ok expat lifestyle . it depends on your salary - a labourer might be conned into coming for 280 riyal a month - god knows how they survive . i got 14,000 + and i decided i was better taking 40,000 aud per annum salary cut and working somewhere costs were cheaper and lifestyle more family friendly i still do n't have a job but i am very happy with my decision to prioritse my kids and leave qatar for the qataris - mostly i found people with families where the women or both parents worked less then satisfied with the cost access to care and quality of care for their kids - people on huge salaries who can afford to join the intercontinental beach club and the wife and kids spent every after schoool moment there seemed satisfied - live in a compound with play facilities and you may be ok . good luck .

try going to travel agents . . they can do something . . or go to the hotels . . in the hotels , tourist visa is 200qr but the problem you have to check-in for about two to three nights . . i did that last time , when my wife came here ... quite costly though . .
sponsorshiip transfer
how may years does one need to continue with his first sponsor in qatar before sponsorship can be transferred ? the current sponsor provides noc . is the criteria 1 year or 2 years . pls advise.thanks
excuse me ...
one year is enough for naql kafala -LRB- sponsorship change -RRB-
qatar malayali , you 're excused ... still wrong
sponshorship change does n't matter if its 1 or 2 years . coz if your current sponsor/employer wo n't give you an noc -LRB- no objection certification -RRB- , you ca n't change sponsorship ... unless it 'll a transfer to a family/husband/wife visa .
thank you for the input . i
thank you for the input . i have some clarity now . there were contradictory views when i checked ; some said for the first transfer one has to wait for 2 years with first sponspor even if he gives noc , some said one year is fine provided noc is there etc. thanks again

the rule is you have to have
the rule is you have to have been with your first sponsor for 2 yrs before you can transfer to another and that too only if you get an noc . if the employer for some reason does give u an noc before the 2 yr period is over you still can not trf your sponsor to a new guy cuz the immigration will not accept . so for such cases you will be working as a ` borrowed ' employee till you complete the 2 yrs . we just faced this situ in our office

re : is it fine to carry party twister gun in flight
anything that has a word gun is banned and you are talking about carrying something that not only has the word gun , but also explodes and makes noice and is bound to go wrong without notice . i do n't know if there is any charge , but yes there is a spring that makes noice and can create panic if explodes .
re : is it fine to carry party twister gun in flight
no . even if it is a plastic toy , they will not allow . i had similar experience .
re : is it fine to carry party twister gun in flight
not allowed even in hold baggage . do n't even try , unless you want to miss your flight . remember you have to answer a declaration when you check in , any false statements lead to arrest -LRB- always ! -RRB-

switzerland visa
does anybody know the latest procedure to apply for switzerland visa from doha ... now that they have made it compulsory for screening , all have to goto kuwait personally ? can someone take schengen visa from german embassy and go directly to switzerland instead of staying in germany first ?
re : switzerland visa
goto german embassy and get chengen visa & enjoy 14/15 countries for six months
re : switzerland visa
nationality : india so there is no requirement to stay/arrive in the country from whose embassy we take schengen visa ? if yes , then thats great news .
re : switzerland visa
hi . i 'm also applying for schengen visa right now and we have the same issue . during the past 3 years i always have to send my documents to swiss embassy in kuwait but since oct 1 , 2012 , they implemented vis which requires personal appearance so they can take your biometric data which will be valid for 5 years . i called the embassy if there is no other alternative than going to kuwait and i was told none . so i decided to change my itinerary and go to germany first so i can apply in german embassy instead . tips . you have to show them that your point of entry is germany and/or you will spend most of your stay in germany . -LRB- tickets and hotel bookings as proof -RRB- . goodluck !

3 pin plugs will work in qatar no problem as the sockets are the same -LRB- they were the last time i was there in 2004 -RRB- tv am not sure as we bought ours in qatar . we bought a dvd player in qatar and it worked fine in the uk with uk bought dvds but again they are cheap enough to buy in qatar .
plug sockets here are all
plug sockets here are all 3-pin uk style . however , you might want to bring a stock of 3-pin to 2-pin adaptors with you because anything you by out here will be 2-pin , and the adapters you buy here are very low quality and i 've seen many catch fire or melt .
adaptors
so if all the plus sockets are 3 pin why are the products 2 pin ? so do you mean i need a 2 pin to 3 pin adaptor ? i am confused ... sorry !
i expect plug sockets are
i expect plug sockets are 3-pin cos qatar used to be protected by the british . just a guess . appliances are 2-pin cos they come from asia i think . it 's juts one of many wonderful things that defies logic here in qatar . you 'll need adapters that plug into the 3-pin wall socket and take a 2-pin plug .
adapters are rubbish
have some patience and change the plugs on new items to 3-pin plugs . i hate the adapters here , as previously mentioned the quality is rubbish and they can melt .
the same applies to the
the same applies to the 3-pin plugs you buy here as the adapters - they are cheap and prone to catching fire . best to bring your own from the uk .
remote car starter device installation
hi , is there a place close to salwa road that they can install a remote starter device to my car ? i have the device already i just need someone to install it . thank you ,
re : remote car starter device installation
while you may find someone to install it , i believe the reason you ca n't find them here is that being `` radio controlled '' they have to be allowed by the government -LRB- in order that the frequency used does n't interfere with any of the official radio frequencies -RRB- - at least that 's what i was told 8 years ago .
re : remote car starter device installation
sorry i wanted to say government not police
re : remote car starter device installation
these devices utilise the unlicensed frequency range which does n't interfere with any gov official radio freq range , just like your cordless phone . any skilled auto electrician should be able to install it , but be careful unskilled technician can damage your car . these remote starters are available for sale at any cars ' access shop -LRB- around 500 qr -RRB- , i have one for sale if you are interested -LRB- brand new , still in box -RRB- .
re : remote car starter device installation
as a single `` user '' perhaps you do n't have to worry . i inquired with a north american manufacturer in order to import and sell them here - they advised that one of the documents required was a government permit for the radio frequency concerned . as i said , it was 8 years ago . times change .

re : export my car
for sure you can ship your car for the purpose . its called as an escort . it is the same procedure that you take the vehicle to other gcc places . you have to apply for a permission to export the vehicle as an escort . but make sure that the vehicle is registered under your name and not in the bank . otherwise you have to obtain an noc from the bank . also there is an additional charge for insurance . then you have to consult a shipment company and you have to make a two way bill . once it reach there in india no need to pay any taxes . as per my knowledge you can use the vehicle there in india up to 1 year

re : car comparison : prado to mazda cx9
mazda cx9 all the way . . it was named best sporty suv of year 2009 and has won several awards ... the only disadvantage would be resell value compared to any toyota . check it out in the market . but the driving experience of the mazda cx9 is way better then prado . . you can watch the reviews on serveral website such as http://www.edmunds.com/

re : car comparison : prado to mazda cx9
cx9 is more crossoverish whereas prado is a proper suv and looks like one too . a toyota is definitely more reliable than mazda .
re : car comparison : prado to mazda cx9
the only advantage of prado is the resale value . both are not real off-road options . so for on-road cx-9 is much more fun to drive -LRB- acceleration & stability -RRB- and much better looking . the myth of the toyota being more reliable is a very local belief that has no facts to support it . also do n't fall for the claim of low cost maintenance of toyota . i have a lc ; the brakes master and booster costs 8000 qar which is double the cadilac escalade that is claimed to be one of the highest when it comes to maintenance cost .

vegetable market and wholesale market
hi , i went to the wholesale market on saturday but could n't buy anything as i had to buy boxes only of vegetables that i would have had to waste ... i was told that there is also a vegetable market where i can buy by the kg ... can anybody explain me where it is ? thanks ...
re : vegetable market and wholesale market
vegetable market you probably went to the one where you park your car in front of a row of shops selling produce ? they sell in volume -LRB- boxes only -RRB- right across from it is the other more visited market . you have to go inside one of the open doors to see the true market . there you can buy just 1 tomato , 1 carrot etc. they are next to each other .
re : vegetable market and wholesale market
i completely disagree with that . in my experience -LRB- over 5 years here now -RRB- the fruit & vegetable market produce is by and far the best you can buy in doha . the grocery stores have improved , but they can not match the freshness from of the wholesale market .
re : vegetable market and wholesale market
thanks everybody ! will try again this weekend and see if we can find it ... it was chaos anyway but a wonderful experience nevertheless !!!
re : vegetable market and wholesale market
is the market open during the evenings ? ????? whats the timings for retail sellers ?

is direct employment safe ?
hi everyone , i 'd like to get your opinion and/or comments ... is it safe to consider direct employment ? would appreciate your feedback ... = -RRB-
nice
thanks whyteknight ... that 's good to hear . . are you from phils ?
lp , it 's true
lp , it 's true
direct employement ...
based on my experience , yes its quite safe than in agency . . more cost beneficial between the employer and employee ...
hi meryl317 . . re your queries . .
if your cousin have the visa already from her present employer ... my advice is to present a standard employment contract which i have a format here if you want i will send you the format on which you will attest or her employer in polo . you can follow there the req . for direct hire .
ilazzie , ask lng sana . na
ilazzie , ask lng sana . na email ko na sa frend ko ang work visa from the company . . i advised her to go to the nearest dhl office para sa authentication ng visa nya . . is it the right step ? and can you please tell me what she needs to do next ? is medical check-up required ? please do advice me , excited na yung frend ko na mkawork dito pero nalilito kami paano i-process ang papers nya sa pinas . .
meryl , english only in the
meryl , english only in the main forum . . what kind of visa does your friend have ? if it 's only visit visa , no need for medical check up , just authentication from the embassy .
if she 's holding a work visa
if she 's holding a work visa she needs to undergo medical examination in the philippines . it 's better to be sure she have all necessary documents , you never know what documents the officers in our airport require . . sometimes , they can be very strict . .
if she is holding a working
if she is holding a working visa , she really needs to undergo medical exam , visa stamping in qatar embassy in phils , also in poea she will be required to submit original copy of her contract .
lp , fortunately the contract
lp , fortunately the contract i submitted in poea was accepted even when it did not have authentication yet from qatar embassy
to treysdad
as per the procedures given to me , i will go to poea only when visa has already been stamped by qatar embassy here in phils ... here is what 's written ... 5 . once the passport with stamped visa was received , proceed to philippine overseas employment administration -LRB- poea -RRB- for verification of the of employment contract and submit the following document for issuance of exit pass or overseas employment certificate -LRB- oec -RRB- : original employment contract visa medical certificate prc license pre-departure orientation seminar certificate -LRB- to be scheduled and provided by poea -RRB- got very nice support from the employer , it was them who introduced ql to me . = -RRB-
will it be safe if i go to
will it be safe if i go to poea only after visa stamping or should i go there even before that ?
you better start
with your medical certificate because it usually takes 3 days to a week for the results . they will only release the results once you have the visa . but it 's better to start it so that if you have problems -LRB- like high sugar , high blood pressure , etc. -RRB- you can take corrective actions or take a second opinion and try to get better medical results and have `` fit to work '' evaluation .
i was supposed to have the
i was supposed to have the medical earlier than receviing the visa but unfortunately the clinic i went required me to present my visa first . hopefully my health did not go bad after undertaking annual physical exam for my current employer . another thing , do you know of any qatar embassy accredited clinics are worth visiting ? i have read in some posts that there are really those clinics who tend to harvest money from aspiring ofws . i wish to go to a clinic that can me fair result whether or not positive but at least it is true . wish ko lang ... heheh . . sa mga taga jan baka meron sila mairecommend na clinics dito sa pinas ...
maybe , just make sure you
maybe , just make sure you check the company that you will be working for ... like i told you , my cousin used to work there but resigned , but she was not directly employed from the phils ...
thank you so much mj . will
thank you so much mj . will you be kind to let me contact your cousin ? i wish to at least ask some few questions ... she/he can contact me at jolisa.b.calib@gmail.com . . would really appreciate it ...
first thing you do when you set your foot here ,
log on to ql ! lol ! good luck , make sure you have the oec and that you will be a documented ofw !
so by direct hire you meant ,
so by direct hire you meant , they will be sending you a working visa from here ? correct me if i 'm wrong . .
to flor1212
thanks , will do that ... = -RRB-
if you are asking about
if you are asking about direct employment versus contract employment , i would prefer direct .
laws in our country discourage it ,
but many try their luck . many safenets were placed to make sure that an ofw will be safe once in foreign country . if you are a direct hire but goes with the official protocols -LRB- except you did not pass through an agency -RRB- , it 's okay because you will be a documented ofw . but if you are a direct hire and not an official ofw , i also discouraged it !
it 's direct employment
it 's direct employment against employment via recruitment agency
recruitment agencies are only
recruitment agencies are only after their commissions so is generally better to go direct , unless the company is disreputable ... ... in which case there are many here .
jlazzzie . .
i am a direct hire . what you need to do is check first the company hiring you . for me it was easy because i knew some compatriots who worked for the company in its different branches here in the gulf region . also please check the process in poea , i believe they have changed it last year . so the process i went through is not the same anymore where i had to go through each step myself . as far as i know it is not anymore `` direct hire '' or `` named hire '' per se as you will need to have your documents processed through an employment agency and not by yourself .
i too was hired direct ...
and its safe . . but as mr. treysdad sez , , , check first the company and then later there are still some papers to process from poea ... congratz and goodluck ! : -RRB-
i will do as you say ... but
i will do as you say ... but the soon-to-be employer even sent me a lengthy step by step procedure to accomplish up to poea ... treysdad hopefully , i wont need agency anymore . my papers are already with the employer for visa processing.hope it would be released this week . jaryz , thanks for your comment ...
how to lose weight ???
hello qler 's , i know you guys getting rid of this question ... but anyone have a quick technique how to lose weight ?? especially tummy part !! thanks !!
re : how to lose weight ???
dieting is effective but its quite slow process , most effective is exercise specially if u do it for abdominal muscles . and make sure to quit 3 things , 1 . sweets 2 . rice 3 . sleeping immediately after having meal . i m sure u wil see better results :-RRB- good luck
re : how to lose weight ???
cmd ???? what is that ?? give me that : - -RRB-
re : how to lose weight ???
hi , honestly , there is no quick way . an unhealthy way is to take a diaretic , but you will lose only water , not fat . that is a temp . fix . as far as medication , there is only one which is called orlistat . it inhibits the enzyme that breaks down fat , so this will allow fats to pass through you . other than that , the other diet aids are false , or caffiene-based . in that case , drink coffee . the not eating rice at night is good advice . remember , it is down to physics : when you eat about 7500 more calories than you burned , you gained a kg . the same is true for losing it .

labour laws
hi , help needed regarding qatar labour laws for expats . a close acquaintance is in grave trouble from company and seeks assistance ... ... whom to approach who can advice about labour laws in qatar ... . . whats the procedure ? ... . . are there any consultants who will guide ... . . any department or office ? reply urgent please . thankyou and god bless ... ... . lady in distress !!
re : labour laws
a department of labor near american hospital will guide your friend what to do . you may try googling the qatar labor laws if you want an insight and might answer your friend 's problem . good luck !!!
re : labour laws
- the labour law states that employers must provide housing or housing allowance . - the employment contract sets the terms and conditions for employment which should include amount of housing or provision of accomodation - the employer should not claim back any money paid for housing as long as this has not been previously agreed . - she can complain at the labour department on c ring road , but this will of course put her in trouble and the company may then terminate her contract and send her back home . - the advise is she needs to reach an agreement with her employer . - one question is if the other company provided her with accomdation , was that for free ? was it agreed with her employer ? - it is very tricky but what does her contract say ? hope this helps

re : is there any one who have image of accp , ccna , or ...
this sounds very fishy ... upload a certificate ? best is to read up on their course content and the institutions accreditation rather than what the certificate looks like .
re : is there any one who have image of accp , ccna , or ...
looks like u r into forging the papers instead of joinning the school ! why do n't u go to the school itself and ask for samples ???
re : is there any one who have image of accp , ccna , or ...
call aptech to give them the certificates directly ... or even better they will help u in printing the certificates for u. . . pple like u are disgrace , asking openly to be part of a forgery ...
re : is there any one who have image of accp , ccna , or ...
it seems you are more interested in looking at graphics & design of the certificates than acquiring knowledge & skills .

wage according to nationality ??
i was wondering why the european expats are being paid quadruple the salary of asians who have the same or even more experience and education ??? at least thats the way it is in my work place .
this kind of practices could
this kind of practices could have been paced out sooner for white collar jobs however for technical jobs it could be the different in approach and superiority to do trouble shooting and problem solving . however for companys doing a simple processes and routines , theres no reason for differences in pay .
supply and demand ,
supply and demand , capitalism 101 pure and simple . if enough well educated , well trained , well experienced , well qualified ` asians ' -LRB- japanese usually get higher offer -RRB- refused to work for a quarter of salary of a comparable europeans then in theory the companies will have to offer more to attract them . unfortunately , in practice for every asian that refuse to work for a quarter of the european 's salary there are ten more lining up to work for one-fifth . i think the question should be re-phrased : why would company hire a european/american/australian / japanese etc for four times the salary of a comparably qualified ` asians ' ????? cheers sk

simply frustrating discrimination !
sorry to say my friends that discriminations are well alive in this country . most of the time asians has more experience and even got higher degree of educations against westerns . the sad reality is that most company are impressed with the way they look and converse in english ... but of course !! that 's their mother tongue . but let them write a proper business letter ... most of them are unprofessional . some company look also for the passport when hiring people . but you know what ? if your company got nonsense recruitment personnel and system ... they easily deceived by westerns . no offense to western people but these point of view are based on facts ... however some of them are qualified as well ... not being unfair and speaking generally .

it 's to do with the cost of living in home countries and other aspects . if you look around , on the whole , a western expat will get more in asia , russia and africa also .
nobody is perfect - i am
nobody is perfect - i am nobody i think arabs are in awe of europeans and afraid of them . i think maybe they feel inferior to them or do not want to look cheap in front of them so they give them more salary to show that they are also superior and can afford them ... even though the european guy maybe out of work and usless in his country and desperate to get some work here.he just wants to come here for a couple of years to have some fun & sun and escape the cold and rain for while and spice up his resume to resettle back with some real work experience . at least thats what i have seen in doha for the last 10 years . i have no grouse against them nor have i been affected adversly by them at any point of time . ... ... just my opinion .
hi alexa , i 'm asking a
hi alexa , i 'm asking a rethorical question about why would companies hire a ` westerner ' -LRB- i prefer to use this term -RRB- for 4 times the salary of ` asians ' . according to a pure cost-benefit point of view , they would expect and should get a quadruple of productivity from the westerner . question is , do they -LRB- companies or state for this matter -RRB- get what they bargained for ? the answer is -LRB- if indeed it is true that westerner are paid 4 times more , a proposition that need to be investigated further -RRB- a resounding yes , as we can see more westerner is arriving and based on the cost benefit principle above , companies feel that they still get ahead by hiring westerners . here we assume that no one -LRB- companies or states -RRB- is stupid enough to prefer losing instead of winning . there 's a catch though . by ` productivity ' they may not only refer to tangible things such as amount of product you produce or sales achievement . it may also include things such as prestige -LRB- ie . this real estate company is under british management -RRB- or something as cynical -LRB- as another poster put it -RRB- fear or subconcious inferiority complex . true or nor , i do n't know ... myself , if i think i am underpaid -LRB- dont really care what my colleages get -RRB- , then i 'll try to negotiate a better deal . if i can not get a better deal , then i try to prove that i am underpaid by looking at a better job that give me more . if i can not find a better job , then may be i 'm paid exactly what my market worth is ... . . might as well shut my mouth and enjoy ... . -LRB- note : ` paid ' here mean the total compensation i get : sallary , job satisfaction , quality of live , traffic , red tapes etc -RRB- . enough bubling past my curfew . adios for tonight , cheers sk

i do n't see any problem with the practice
... of ` pay for nationality ' . the labour laws of qatar are primitive and pre industrialization practices have continued to date . companies need to realize that the world has moved forward . the logic behind this practice is not ignorance as many would think , it is more of a feeling of applying economics around cost of living in the country of origin and extrapolating it to arrive at the salary figures . this has been taken directly from saudiaramco . source : - a study conducted by friedunicorn - vol i -LRB- september ,1999 -RRB-

that is why we are getting 3 or more times the salary , we are not late to work , not sick day all the time . pride in our work . and as stated quality of work . . i have worked in 4 countries where it positions are for only western . when they had local or asian in the job it all went to crap so to say , i was hired to clean the place up and set it back on track . the procedures were in place but the asians or local where too lazy to follow the path . safety was one of the main issues , accountability and having the work complete not just having the box ticked . i am happy they employ asians here , it makes us guys look good . so thank you for your poor quality of workmanship and organization skill , you qualification may be high on paper . . but thats as far as it goes . again . thank you rules are a guideline for intelligent people , but they must be adhered to by idiots .

to be individualistic , , , which is not the case at all in the east , , , this allows westerners to make an informed decision on the spot ... and westerners come in all colours , i was not narrowing the field to whites , , , , like it , lump it , do what you want with it , but its the truth , , , i am just being objective ...
what is a westerner ?
what is a westerner ? someone who is from europe , us , canada etc. ? or someone who comes from a developed country ? there are many of us going around whom are paid salaries that is the same as local hire or asian hire also in many countries ! do not think it is fair to generalise that westerners get paid more for everything . it depends on the job and scope that you are involved in . also bear in mind , even though qatar is personal income tax free , some expats still have to pay taxes or other in their home countries which also accounts for higher pays .
i suppose a person on western wages ...
... ca n't afford to spend a lot of time during the day on ql - too much work and responsibilities ... and that 's just one reason . for once i have to agree with jackfrost : quote : ' i have worked in 4 countries where it positions are for only western . when they had local or asian in the job it all went to crap so to say , i was hired to clean the place up and set it back on track . the procedures were in place but the asians or local where too lazy to follow the path . safety was one of the main issues , accountability and having the work complete not just having the box ticked . ' he needs some work on his english skills but i have to agree with him . my husband has been working overseas for over 30 years now and the responsibility will only be given to somebody who can take the shit the position makes you go through and actually deal with it . you need to be firm , have capacity to argue the necessary points and leadership personality . and unfortunately there are a lot of people who lack these requirements .
life is not
really fair ... if it does then there would no poor or rich and just same stature in life . we just need to accept the fact and live with it `` we can not change the past , we only learnt from it ''
that could be a reason
that could be a reason arabic_nightingale along with the colour of the skin too . . all the other reasons mentioned above are plain nonsense in my opinion . i am willing to put my education and knowledge to the test against any of the western expatriates working here in similar field and there wo n't be much difference . as for someone mentioning above that indians come here because they ca n't get job anywhere else , well i work for the same company here for which i was working in india , the company which picked me from my campus so maybe the desire of not leaving that company got me here rather than any lack of job opportunity . <a href="http://s1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/?action=view&current=angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpg" target="_blank"> <img src="http://i1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpg" border="0" alt="photobucket"> </a>

mp i love what i do and i get paid 4 times here for the same thing i was doing back home so i stay . . i already accepted that , i am just saying he gets more pay because of higher cost of living in his home country and his skin colour , not because he is better than me at what we do like some people are suggesting here . <a href="http://s1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/?action=view&current=angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpg" target="_blank"> <img src="http://i1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpg" border="0" alt="photobucket"> </a>
colour discrimination occurs
colour discrimination occurs everywhere , if you do n't know that then you have lived in a very protective world . higher cost of living back home matters as most of the expats are working here to save money and one day go back home to settle down with their savings here . <a href="http://s1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/?action=view&current=angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpg" target="_blank"> <img src="http://i1005.photobucket.com/albums/af179/sandeepkadian/angry-man-wallpaper-1.jpg" border="0" alt="photobucket"> </a>

i have a basic question . for
i have a basic question . for how many indians , middle east is first choice for work ? usually , those who work here are already rejected from us and european countries -LRB- and 70 % are rejected by their own country -RRB- i do n't know about other fields , but the doctors working in middle east are substandard compared to their own counterparts in india and the european doctors are even more substandard to these already substandard doctors . now , the conclusion is that quality control is a joke here . employing few europeans -LRB- and one or two americans -RRB- makes things look good . but they ca n't afford more than few and so they employ majority asians at cheapest rates to be cost effective , and the end result is a substandard organisation which spends lots of money , has poor performance and manipulated quality control -LRB- usually through media -RRB- . are you nuts ? ... . no doubt i am crazy about you !
quite clearly , you have n't
quite clearly , you have n't the faintest idea what you 're talking about & you have n't interacted with a lot of educated , informed , well travelled non-westerners ... probably has something to do with the fact that you 're a racist bigot ... there 's an informed decision ... from a non-westerner ... deal with it ...
/ - a-t - / sun26872 ... middle
@ sun26872 ... middle east is first choice for many indians so you 're completely wrong about that one , for a lot of indians , they do n't mind coming to the mideast ` cos it 's just a 3hr . flight from home , earnings are tax-free & there are a lot of people from their community/town/village ... they ca n't find that in the west , it 's too cold from them for half the year or more , it 's halfway around the world & no way would they be able to afford that 16 hr . flight ticket once a year like they do here & they pay tax on their earnings , put yourself in their shoes , would the west still be your first choice ? ... i thought not ... you are right about the fact that most of the good indian doctors -LRB- & india produces some of the best on the planet as i presume you know already -RRB- choose to stay @ home or go west but it would be unfair to say that because of that all indian doctors in the mideast are substandard or the european doctors here for that matter ... a lot of them move , again for the tax-free income , to try a new place , a new lifestyle , a life partner who 's based here , there are so many things that factor into that descision ... quality control as you rightly stated is in most cases a joke but again that does n't apply across the board ... a well trained person , wherever it is they are from , is unlikely to compromise on standards ...

if you knew my salary , jackfrost , you will get a frostbite . i am agree with everyone that if you have signed a contract , you should n't complaint . likewise , i maintain that europeans and americans working here are of inferior quality than their asian counterpart , but i do n't have a problem with that too because their salary does n't come from my account . europeans are very good only in one aspect that they can convince people of their lies.but i personally consider a great quality to be a convincing liar because nothing succeeds like money . i wish we asians learn to stop working hard and start convincing people of our leadership qualities and individualism . but then who will do the real work ? are you nuts ? ... . no doubt i am crazy about you !

to make it easy for some people to understand
i will give you an example that might show you a reason why lets say filipinos as mentioned in this thread are earning little bit less than other nationalities : check this address , or else read below my comment to one filipina lady who envy others who get more than her husband : http://www.qatarliving.com/node/825227 x is a civil engineer from manila working in w consturction company and earning 5000 usd per month . y is a civil engineer from us working in w construction company and earning 7500 usd per month . both x and y has 13 years experiance in thier field . why x earns 5000 usd and y earns 7500 usd per month ? discrimination ? my opinion is : - x needs to work in w construction company for 5 years to save money for buying a house back home in the philippines . - y needs to work in w construction company for 15 years to save money for buying a house back home in the us . - x has one son only who goes to z university -LRB- one of the best well known expensive universities in the philippines -RRB- where the fees are 30 000 peso -LRB- 2300 qr !! -RRB- per year . - y has one son also who goes to g university -LRB- which is one of the humble small universities in california -RRB- where the fees are 20 000 usd -LRB- 73 000 qr -RRB- . - x has a wife working in kuwait with one son only and a mistress in manila and a gf in qatar . he has to support himself only and maybe send some gifts for his son from time to time . - y has a wife who is taking care of 6 children back home and he is the only one responsible for the whole family . - if x is single and would like to get married , it wo n't cost him more than lets say 100 000 peso -LRB- 7600 qr -RRB- for one of the best wedding in a luxarious cruise in the ocean . - if y is single and originate , but a muslim , he can not get married with less than 100 000 usd -LRB- 365 000 qr -RRB- due to how expensive are weddings in the us , hotels , wedding planner companies , the mahr -LRB- might reach millions -RRB- which is supposed to be given to the wife as a gift to buy all what she needs and would love to have . many empployers know these facts and many others when recruiting staff . if any of us is not satisfied with his job , then he better go straight home , or is it only jelousy and envy ? for what ? although his income is more than yours , most probably you got better life than him back home . better house , your kids are enrolling in better schools and universities ... etc so please enough envy .
maybe the answer
is how much you have negotiated your salary ? i have one main principle regarding this story : you are asking for an amount . if you are receiving what you have asked for , why are you complaining . if the offer is lower , why have you accepted it ? on the other hand i know a lot of indians or iranians that are paid better than me . so , maybe is not the nationality . each of us consider himself the most beautiful/handsome , the smartest , the most skilled etc. person . maybe is not true , have you think about this ??

on a general level ,
on a general level , westerners seem to be able to demonstrate better levels of leadership and trouble shooting . -LRB- just see how many countries are there in the west that are poor/under developed/developing compared to asia/africa . and its not that they have an advantage of natural resources or climate over others -RRB- they can also sell themselves well . they also tend to grasp the bigger picture well , compared to the asians who excel in specialising in a particular discipline of study . but then , this is only a generalisation . this is not to say there arent any asians who cant do the same . whether you look at mittal/tata/sony etc and what they have achieved in the west , the asians who work at high profile jobs in western countries or the iim/iit graduates who are almost completely recruited by western companies , there are enough proofs for asian talent and capabilities . but the issue is that , due to the problems intrinsic to the demographics of asian population , there is quite a sizeable chunk of the population who have not been fortunate enough to get the same kind of education and exposure that their more fortunate counterparts could attain . this particular section , which is quite sizeable , tips the balance when it comes to the general world view of the quality of asian workforce . also , i am not quite sure how it works out in the west . do they pay less for asian employees , like here in the middle east ? if not , that is another pointer , which could tell us that the workforce from asia that ends up in gulf -LRB- that includes yours truly -RRB- is somehow the ones that couldnt make it in their own homes or in the west . it could also mean the me perception of asians has a hand in this . before accusing anybody of racism in this matter , what the asians should think about is , what exactly weighs in favor of the westerner and how to make the same factor work for them . its not skin , its more than passport , its the brand that has been created around it . like how sony made it in the west.morita knew how to combine creative , cost-effective engineering -LRB- their core philosophy -RRB- with product marketing and brand creation.end of the day , its about brand creation . as much as i have seen brilliant managers from west , i have also seen ones who have reached that position simply by virtue of their passport . that is what you call brand value . -LRB- not saying that there arent local/asian managers who have been lucky in a similiar way , for them its other reasons -RRB- have we reached a place where we are ready to launch that brand that would do half the selling for us ? till then , asians will have to put up with lesser pays . coz like everything , one day , `` this too shall pass ''

laurana , honestly , after all the professional frustrations i 've been through here , the only reason that retains me in this country is the money ! i can ensure you that me experience is not an asset and it is often seen as a disadvantage when you 'll try to reintegrate the western job market . it is well known in the west that the professional standards in the me are very low . there are several reasons , just to name a few : blind localization and promotions of unqualified , non-competent and uneducated local people in lead positions ; low work-force salaries , non-existent real hr policies , etc. . . nobody is motivated here to pursue a career as all know that wo n't happen ... and so many more ... in summary this is not a normal country where hard work , innovation , leadership and results are rewarded accordingly . this is a country where the wealth pours out of the soil , regardless people being hard working or being passive and do the minimum to get the most ... the second scenario is the actual reality and the locals are to lazy or to incompetent or the hopeless to control this disgrace .

sandeep . .
i would disagree and suggest that it 's probably a lebanese outfit . .
it depends on the company ,
it depends on the company , and the contract . in my company , the position dictates the salary and there is some `` wiggle room '' in negotiating a higher salary or benefits if you bring something spectacular to the table -LRB- like great negotiating skills , i guess -RRB- . i do n't know how it is elsewhere , but i guess my question is : if you are so unhappy with your contract , why did you sign it ?
laurana
people who complain why others get more than them are usually social climbers who ca n't eat back home , and once they come here they forget about thier origin and start comparing themself with others . why and why ? to make it short , if you do n't like it , get the hell out of here and go somewhere else . thats it .

nitro air tyre pressure ???
can anyone tell me what 's the difference between normal air tyre pressure and nitro air tyre pressure , is it ok for daily ride ? does it wear long then normal air ? how can we feel the difference ? which tyre center offering nitro air ??
re : nitro air tyre pressure ???
for a racecar it will make a difference , for you - nothing . the advantage of nitrogen in tires is that the airpressure will raise less than with air when you drive fast .
re : nitro air tyre pressure ???
i have it before on my previous car and it really helps on the tires , especially during summer , because this nitro air will help to cool your tire.if you want nitro air on your tire , q tyres in salwa road have it ... . keep it cool ...
re : nitro air tyre pressure ???
hi . . i am using this nitrogen in my car 's tires . . really it is good . . i use it because i travel alot with my car it keep the wheel cold in summer . . hardly increase or loss in pressure during driving and with time . . goodluck
re : nitro air tyre pressure ???
n2 -LRB- nitrogen -RRB- is the stabil gas will not change the composition when receive heat . normally in summer the road is litle bit hot the friction between road and tire can change the composition of normal air in side tire . if you will make along journey or you want to make race recommended to pressurise with nitrogen but ensure quality of tire in excelent condition .

hi dan , there 's more mid age expats here than young ones . but there are young pple as well and i 'm sure you 'll meet some . you need to be patient though . social life here seems a bit slow - even inshallah sounds too fast to describe it . you meet people but because of cultural differences it takes time to find someone on the same wavelength .

qatar mosque praying
how are the praying time announced ? do they announce the time from a public speaker so everyone can hear ?
we pray 5 times aday each
we pray 5 times aday each prayer time differs on daily basis according to the day or night lenghth -LRB- the difference may be 1 minute every day `` more or less '' -RRB- the timing is avilable everywhere : on the net , on athan softwares or in the calendars in a small table in everyday 's paper . the mo'athen who is responsible for making athan which is cosidered as the official announcement of prayer time thae mo'athen make the athan in the mic . at the specific time . then after a pre-determined time he make iqama which is the announcement for people who came to the masjid after athan to stand up for the prayer the time between athan & iqama is varied between 5 to 25 minutes according to the prayer e.g : fajr -LRB- dawn -RRB- 25 , maghhrib -LRB- sunset -RRB- 5 ... etc. .
reason
the only reason i 'm asking is because i 'm unfamilar with the islam culture and the religion . i just wanted to get a idea of how the prayer time were set because i do n't want to cross path with anyone during that time . you see , i 'm moving to qatar in may and i think it would beneficial to me to know at least the basic of islam . since islam require the follower to pray five times a day , i was wondering if it troublesome for someone who is not islam to be sound asleep during the pa call out .
so it is all about
so it is all about sleep !! do n't worry it is not very loud and if : it wo n't take more than 3 minutes ! and u will be awake in 3 prayers at least !! happy dreams
inside each mosque there 's a
inside each mosque there 's a mic . the imam or the personne in charge makes the first call to allow people to get ready after few mn he makes the second call and the prayer begins .

re : where is a good place to buy an acoustic guitar ?
badie studio is probably the best bet for stylish electric guitars , though they have a good deal of acoustics too . yamaha on the other hand , probably best known for amateurs , does n't have a appeal to both sound and style . if you are really a music guru , then you should buy a fender . details : music corner fax : +974 4374586 , mail : musiccorner@qatar.net.qa

1 - its easy to get it , it takes time though 1-2 weeks , even if you have one in your own country . 2 - depends on the model and condition 3 - yeah they are but most of them are garbage . and the good ones cost too much . riding in traffic is suicide however , qatar has , without a shadow of a doubt , the worst traffic in the world . all they like to do is blame other nationalities for being bad drivers while its them who contributes to it . i have motorcycles here btw , but only ride at night well after 11 usually . cause yeah , car drivers are depressingly bad here . they are usually surprised when they see a motorcycle and dont know how to react to one near them . they will turn without looking , get into the fast lane and drive 20 below the limit , stomp on the brakes and come to a virtual stop at the speed cameras . i can go on and on but i dont wan na stay here all night to describe just how horrible car drivers in qatar are .

would you recommend jeep wrangler as a good buy ?
any good and bad experiences with jeep wrangler ?
re : would you recommend jeep wrangler as a good buy ?
wow ... where do i start ... haha give us some more information , what year ? model ? from the dealer or 2nd hand ? then , i can tell you more !
re : would you recommend jeep wrangler as a good buy ?
not a good buy . i would never recommend it even as a second car for off road activity .
re : would you recommend jeep wrangler as a good buy ?
all ammrican cars have bad resale value in qatar . you should expect to loose around 30 % to 35 % on the cost of the car in the first year .
re : would you recommend jeep wrangler as a good buy ?
i had a jeep not so long ago and i pleased to say ` goodbye '
re : would you recommend jeep wrangler as a good buy ?
hasan is right on the resale value . the 4-door wrangler should do you fine as a daily driver and work out for camping trips . i guess you got ta love the car if you 're going to buy an older one . either way , good luck finding a car that suits you !
re : would you recommend jeep wrangler as a good buy ?
id watch out if i were you in regards to the resale value for sure in addition , i prefer the older engines , 2004 and down if im not mistaken . the 4.0 ? the new 3.7 feels so tied up while flooring it . dam all the eco constraints theyre enforcing on the big boy cars nowadays conclusion : if you want it for an everyday car , then dont want it that much , you could do better if you are into poping the bonnet every now and then and enjoy it , go for it -LRB- preferably older -RRB- as mentioned in previous threads
re : would you recommend jeep wrangler as a good buy ?
i follow carefully reports and reviews on cars regarding durability , maintenance and reliability . to be honest , dodge and chrysler -LRB- including jeep -RRB- are among the least reliable cars around . a recent study by forbes in the usa shows that these manufacturers along with gmc top their list of least reliable cars . a list which no japanese or korean manufacturer made ! interestingly , cars manufactured by ford for the past five years are among the most reliable . jeeps have been well known for their mountain and dune climbing capabilities , but when it comes to road driving , you 'd better slow down before buying one and see all other alternatives . a ford explorer may be a good choice if you are looking for an american car at the same price tag -LRB- or even cheaper -RRB- than the jeep . but for qatar , if you can , get your self one of these : 1 - toyota prado . 2 - nissan pathfinder or x-terra 3 - mitsubishi pajero 4 - honda pilot they are the least to lose at reselling by order . they are also very reliable and have a large range of options to choose from .

re : facial cream for whitening

re : facial cream for whitening
my friend , the best is go to dermatologist and examine your face sensitivity . you may apply a lot of facial cream and your face might react on it differently . some are cheap and some are expensive but must be sure first of your skin properties before applying on it .
re : facial cream for whitening
try ... tea tree from body shop
re : facial cream for whitening
you are quite a brave man to ask this question . however , since you are a qatari , i do n't think that there is any cream that can turn you inot an ammerican .

@crazyjoy , find me a 32gb factory unlocked 3gs in qatar and i 'll buy 10 . the cheapest i 've seen so far is starlink at 3,800 and also seen them for 3,100 in hongkong . if you bought it for 3,100 then there 's delivery , risk of customs tax , and/or damage . best case it would be 3,400 to your door :-RRB- anyway , i recommend getting an iphone factory unlocked rather than unlocking it because everytime you update you will have to worry . if you want to unlock it just use ipwn . __________________________ <a href="http://blog.iloveqatar.net"> <img src="http://iloveqatar.net/images/mrqql.png" border="0"> mr. q 's blog - a qatari 's view on qatar . </a>

we had that done at a relatives house here . it wasnt the entire ceremony as there are restrictions to that and not possible to bring in a priest so it was a simple ceremony but we got registerd at the embassy legalising it .
tinkerbell
that clears a lot of things . i was specifically talking about the qatari family court . some expat communities in qatar have some kind of marriage officials over here , whether it is at their embassies or outside . in my case , since my wife and i are of different nationalities , we could not get married at the embassy .
ichwill - some laws in this
ichwill - some laws in this country just amaze me . different rules for diff nationalities for the same issue . at the end of the day it all boils down to money ... dont understand why they cant just take the cash and make things simpler !!!!

as far as the family court is concerned only one law applies to all nationalities . they genuinely did not care what our nationalities were . they only care about religion ... i am not saying that is any better .
ichwill - yeah that
ichwill - yeah that too ... case to case scenario actually . in this instance yes its religion but there are many other issues pertaining to visas etc and every nationality has something diff to produce . believe me the ppl sitting at the counters themselves have differing opinions on what papaers need to be submitted for what ... recent hair raising exp with my labour card ... & ^ & & %

britexpat ;
britexpat ; yes , someone who was employed by a company here and on a seperate rp . employer / sponsor has nothing to do with marriage of employee . provided both bride and groom have valid rps in qatar , the family court in qatar will only ask for a letter of approval from the father of the bride if he is not physically present in the court during the wedding , and an attested/translated civic record or something that proves the bride is not married . in addition to doing a medical test and bringing 2 witnesses to court , there is nothing else to it . however , keep in mind that the family court here will only marry a muslim male to a muslim or christian female . they will not carry out the marriage of the groom is not a muslim or if the bride is not a muslim nor christian . only one exception to this rule : female cabin crew working at qatar airways .

best supermarket in doha ?
i usually shop at megamart ... it 's expensive but the produce is better than other places i 've been , and they have a wider selection of gourmet foods . has anyone tried the greenbox or knows of other supermarkets with good produce ?
agree with lp
plus , ask for advice on the location of a product at your peril ... staff take no pride in their job and do n't bother learning what the store even sells , so ask where something is , and be prepared to get a blank stare unless it is generic -LRB- who asks where obvious things are , anyway ? -RRB-
the greenbox is not a shop .
the greenbox is not a shop . you can order from them and they will deliver your order to your house . http://www.thegreenbox.me/
thanks nomerci
i have just been on the website and will give them a try , i have really missed fruit and veg that is fresh or at least edible . thanks for starting the thread ajnelson hope you get something out of it as well .

carrefour , spinneys and foodworld choice . i really enjoy shopping at foodworld choice . they really have a very friendly and clean shopping environment . and their customer service is excellent which you can not find in other supermarkets like lulu and safari . although some items are expensive they make it sure they have the highest quality of the product.and they have imported items from uk and usa .

there are many jobs for ladies but i think she will face problum in getting visa as she is single . -LRB- no visa class for gf in qatar -RRB- . unless she applied for some peramadical staff which dont requied any blood relation or husband to be here in qatar . or if your goin marry soon then she can have many options .
work visa for single ladies ...
it 's quite hard to get work visa for single ladies these days unless your employer is one of the q companies . our company tried to hire single ladies for office administration jobs but found it hard to get a work visa for them . finally settled on hiring husband sponsored ladies . i also heard some single lady teacher assistants in some private schools unfortunately were let go because of the same situation and had to be replaced also with ladies with husband-sponsored visas . but you can try your luck .

re : moving to qatar for the summer
bring chiller if you do n't like hot water bath .
re : moving to qatar for the summer
bad idea ... as you said you have an 8 months old baby then it will be useless to spend summer here ... bcoz you will have to stay at home all the time with kids in the a/c ... secondly you stay in al-khor and its a boring place . . atleast in doha city a person never gets bored . . anyways all of us gave you our suggestions and the rest depends on you ... if you still plan to spend summer vaccations then you are welcome ... how long your hubby has been staying here ?
re : moving to qatar for the summer
thanks for all the answers , he is there nearly 8 months , i no it is going to be very hot thats what is putting me off about going out for the summer with the kids , anyways i 'm just going to have to make my mind up soon ha!thanks for the help

not a good idea at all . most mums going home with the kids , playgroup and coffee morning shuts . very hot to go outdoor . your life will confine house - car - shops

does a diet rich in garlic , onions and hot indian spices give immunity against h1n1 flu ?
are asians more resistant to this new strain of influenza ? do statistics coroborate this view ?
re : does a diet rich in garlic , onions and hot indian ...
there have n't been enough cases for them to collaborate statistics on which cultures are more prone to being infected . an no , i highly doubt asians , or those who eat those types of food have any particular immunity to it . it is very similar to the common cold , however because it is new , no one has an immunity to it because no one has ever been exposed to it before . the best you can do is eat healthily and provide your body with adequate nutrition so that your immune system is as strong as it can be to fight it off .

re : im a pinay , i have this friend , he 's a qatari citizen ...
even if he is not a qatari citizen , he can apply a tourist visa for you . the only thing he will do is to ask any of the travel agency here in doha and apply a tourist visa for you which is valid for 15 days up to maximum of 30 days . your passport is the only requirements .

aramex vs fedex or dhl ?
recently , i spotted a post about aramex and thought it was a neat service . my husband , however , was less than impressed , saying we could use fed ex or dhl . if you like aramex , what are the pros over other companies ? also , if anyone 's sent/received time sensitive documents through this company , i 'd like to know how your experience went . thanks !
re : aramex vs fedex or dhl ?
dears , its a matter of support what these companies are getting in based country ; as well as there own resources ; however i experienced fedex excellent in uae , as well as dhl here in qatar . aramex , no idea sorry .
re : aramex vs fedex or dhl ?
writing my experience with all of them , , i found dhl best in sending time sensative documents . . !! moreover , as per my conversation with one of the managers in dhl -LRB- who is also my friend -RRB- told me , the pressure is much less due to lack of business in recessions . . so , this makes me sure that their service will be better & faster as none of your things would be queued or neglected .
re : aramex vs fedex or dhl ?
-LRB- dalsey , hillblom and lynn -RRB- dhl ... -LRB- period -RRB-
re : aramex vs fedex or dhl ?
i 've sent n received too many times with all of them.each time i experienced to send sensetive papers as you meantioned.but what i noticed that dhl is the fastest one incase you have limited time n hurry for something . and as a personal view i say all are safe enough and well servicing.the worse thing is ; you have to pick up ur stuff from their office after they informed u that you have a shipment.would be better if they could delivery at the door . wish you the best .
re : aramex vs fedex or dhl ?
well i dont know about others but found dhl good always as i only have used dhl always .
re : aramex vs fedex or dhl ?
my choice is dhl
re : aramex vs fedex or dhl ?
although i have tried aramex for auto parts , i still prefer dhl or fed ex . they can all deliver door-to-door . i was not very impressed with aramex 's delivery time .
re : aramex vs fedex or dhl ?
me and my wife would use aramex to send documents for our distance educ classes based in australia . we chose aramex over dhl because of the pricing they give . they can deliver it quickly enough , though of course dhl and fedex -LSB- or ups -RSB- are better at that . but with pricing , i 'd say aramex . for documents that is . but with jewelries or gadgets , etc , im not really sure i 'd chose aramex to deliver those for me .

there 's no ikea in doha .
there 's no ikea in doha . they 've been playing with plans of opening one up for years . closest is in dubai . i just came from there today . they will ship your purchases to doha , but you have to go there in person and buy the stuff . delivery time is 5-7 days . the price is 3.7 dirham per kg , but a minimum fee of 300 dihram . worth it , if you buy a lot . supposedly there 's a catch my friends told me about after i got back from dubai -LRB- i 'm currently looking for new friends ;-RRB- -RRB- . the weight price they quote is not just regular kg 's , but kg in terms of volume . in essence they said you can expect to pay twice of what they 've quoted you . but , i guess i 'll know the exact answer to that in 5-7 days , when my goods arrive . if everything seems under control , you 're just not going fast enough ...

sponsership transfer
i am working in qatar from nov 2010 with same company . now i got new job and my company provided noc . my new company required sponsership transfer . can i apply sponsership transfer before 2 years ? very urgent
i do n't know these days , but
i do n't know these days , but back in 2007 it is possible , i was able to transfer my sponsorship to another employer , working for less than 2 years with the previous employer .
what is the procedure ?
what is the procedure ?
i agree with coyboy2k12 ...
first u should complet 2 years with the previous company to have right in changing sponsorship otherwise u can get 6 months -LRB- iaara -RRB- . awaiting for the 2 years to be complet then u can change sponsorship . best of luck .
i think coyboy , emy and
i think coyboy , emy and translator is correct . you can get the iaara till you complete two years .
iaara not acceptable . any
iaara not acceptable . any other opton ?
if iyara na possible , then
if iyara na possible , then exit qatar and come back with the new visa , you mentioned they 've give you an noc . simple as that !
get new visa
follow mccoyvq 's idea . exit qatar & come back with new visa . u have noc in hand . gudluck .
yes as long as you have a noc
yes as long as you have a noc letter from your previous employer !
no you cant until unless you
no you cant until unless you complete 2 years . then only you can transfer sponsorship . but you have option that you can take 6 months `` yara '' or `` vara '' i do n't know the exact word . but your company madoop -LRB- pro -RRB- knows very well . by this procedure you can legally work for new company . after completing 2 years you can transfer sponsorship permanently . all the best .
as coyboy2k12 mentioned , you
as coyboy2k12 mentioned , you can take i3ara `` borrowing '' for 6 months , and after the 2 years they can transfer the sponsorship .

foreign marriage in egyptian embassy ?
my boyfriend and i are planning to get married here . he is an egyptian muslim , i am a filipina christian and both valid resident visa holders . my embassy could only marry both philippine citizens . can anyone please let me know if we can get married in his embassy ? if not , where here in qatar can we do it and what are the requirements ? thank you in advance for your answers .
re : foreign marriage in egyptian embassy ?
dont get married . you might regret it later !
re : foreign marriage in egyptian embassy ?
your boy friend who is egyptian should ask his embassy as you did and asked your embassy . for your information the egyptian emabssy does not register foreign marriage here in qatar . you have an option to go to normal islamic marriage here in qatar and get a marriage certificate from qatari authorities submit it to the egyptian embassy then they will give you a visit visa to egypt accompanied with your husband . than go to egypt and register your marriage in egypt all the best and good luck .
re : foreign marriage in egyptian embassy ?
first of all he is agree to marry you ? go with him to consult with your embassy first then qatar authoriti certificates in order to . . follow the planning man advise
re : foreign marriage in egyptian embassy ?
think many many times before you get married to other nationalities and different religion as the others said you might regret it someday ! the phil embassy will not marry you , sorry for that but you might find another legal way . goodluck !
re : foreign marriage in egyptian embassy ?
i have the same case and interested to know about muslim-christian marriages . though i am satisfied and happy with my relationship with my egyptian boyfriend , i also advise you think about this a lot of times before deciding to marry him ... and make sure that he is not married in egypt , he may be seem like the perfect man but as you know , some people are deceiving .

tv , internet , landline package
i 've looked on qtel website and there does n't seem to be an `` all in '' package for tv , internet and landline . do you have to get each seperately and add on the premium packages like show sports , abu dhabi sports etc ?
when on the qtel website
when on the qtel website looking at tv packages , it states in small print that that cost of each package includes basic 1mb and landline . had mine installed the other week . i think many people , including myself have to have the basic 250qr package installed then can update once installed . i expected the internet to be appalling but it actually isnt that bad ! when streaming uk sites through my vpn connection , it runs smoothly and does not cut out . i 've added the sports channels now but to be fair , even if you paid top dollar for all the tv channels , the vast majority of them are pretty naff .

family visa for would be spouse ?
my friend want to apply for family visa for his would be wife ... they are getting married in june09 and bring along the family when he returns . is it possible to get family visa like this ? pls share your experience and knowledge . . thanks
re : family visa for would be spouse ?
to get family visa he needs to show his marriage certificate and other related doc . after marriage he can bring his wife on visit.after entering spouse name on passport . after his wife coming for visiting if he has qatar riyal 7000 he wil get family visa . as much as i know .
re : family visa for would be spouse ?
a would-be wife can not be considered to have a family visa . after marriage , only then that the immigration will consider his would-be wife under family status upon submission of the marriage certificate . your friend must wait then .
re : family visa for would be spouse ?
dear proposer , in normal case , you friend will need to have a short wait where he completes the paperworks for his wife to join him . yes , there 's a way if he wants his wife to come along with him . his marriage is on june '09 -LRB- ie the custom or social marriage -RRB- . but he could go for a court marriage at an earlier date , and be legally married -LRB- if not socially -RRB- . he could then submit all the necessary papers and get his wife 's visa well in advance -LRB- of course , if he meets other criterion -RRB-

good place to learn sailing and do watersports
hi all , i would like to learn sailing and do some watersports like kayaking and jet sky . where is the best place in doha to enrol for such activities ? any idea of the fee ?
re : good place to learn sailing and do watersports
to my understanding there is a sailing club in the ritz-carlton / diplomatic club area . you might want to try it in there . as per jetskiing may be go aside to intercon and there you can rent a jetski either for 1/2 hr or 1 hr and have some fun . best of luck ... regards
re : good place to learn sailing and do watersports
when i visited doha i 've been at the sailing club and it is really cheap compared to european costs . for about 2000 qr per year you can access to the club and use the lasers and 470 boats . i suppose they can offer also lessons , but with the quite wind that blow in doha it is really easy to learn . actually i hate the noisy and polluted jet sky , so my suggestion is lear to sail and you will never live without . cheers from italy !
re : good place to learn sailing and do watersports
sasuke , where is that sailing club ? is the one at the diplomatic club or another one ?
re : good place to learn sailing and do watersports
the doha sailing club is located when you come from the mariott back to doha , it is the first gate on your right on the mainroad , immediately after the mariott roundabout . go down to the clubhouse & inquire there . -LRB- big parking in front -RRB-
re : good place to learn sailing and do watersports

why does n't the government vet pick up the phone ?
i have been trying for days to get a hold of the government vet to inquire about the feral cat problem in our area . i have heard they will capture neuter and release , if you can get ahold of them . anyone have any luck with this ??
re : why does n't the government vet pick up the phone ?
honestly - do n't bother calling as they will never answer ! forget fax and email as well ! you have to go down in person to the animal resource department on airport road and talk to someone there . they 're open between 6.30 am and 1.30 pm sunday - thursday . if it 's one or two cats they will lend you traps that you can set , trap the cats and take in before 10am for neutering . they can be collected the following morning and you can re-release them into your area if it 's a large population then they will probably arange to come and trap them themselves and release them .
re : why does n't the government vet pick up the phone ?
chelsea thank you for that info - we also have a major cat problem on our compound and i need to get hold of them but i work -LRB- and they really wo n't give me time off to go to the animal welfare place -RRB- . you do n't happen to know if they are open a little later in the day ? many thanks j

is `` arhaan '' muslim name ?
arhaan a muslim name ? if yes : what is meaning ?
re : is `` arhaan '' muslim name ?
gotcha did you try searching on the net before posting ?? i found this http://wiki.answers.com/q/what_is_the_meaning_of_arhan regards !!
re : is `` arhaan '' muslim name ?
yes , i searched on net , it is not clear , in your link its showing the meaning of arhan or arahan .
re : is `` arhaan '' muslim name ?
to use the same source as the first answer , but with the spelling you gave http://wiki.answers.com/q/what_is_the_meaning_of_arhaan means ruler , but does not define origin , which my earlier post suggests is aboriginal not islamic .
re : is `` arhaan '' muslim name ?
beloved brother/sister , there is no such thing as a ` muslim ' name ; for one is recognized as a believer in the sight of allah swt because of his belief and deeds , not because of his name . the meaning of this name is `` ruler '' and it 's origin is indian . and if one wishes to name their child ` arhaan ' , it would be a perfectly acceptable name in islam . if the question was ` is it a good name ? ' , then we would advice that there are plenty of better names one may keep for their children .

editing/deleting comments
lately i found out that author of threads can self regulate their thread . i mean , the author can edit/delete unwanted comments as the author wish to ! is this true or as i understand it that only the moderators can do the editing and deletion of another person 's comment ! as i understand it also , one can edit his/her own comment but never other 's comment ! does this policy holds true ?

chill out dude ! all i know
chill out dude ! all i know is that ql is n't run as a business , and the owners and mods all have their own lives to lead outside of the website , so it 's inevitible that some questions go unanswered and some threads/classifieds go unmoderated . if it 's that important ask them again , though personally i ca n't see that anything to do with ql can be that important .

dear fiends , one of my friend have worked in qatar and his visa will be expiring on january 2012 , at the same time he got a job in oman . he did n't cancel his qatar visa and he went as a vacation only . now the period of vacation is not even 6 month . so he wanted to come to qatar from oman and he wants to re-new his qatar visa . is it possible to do like that ? so pleas advice me on this regards ...
re : how to re-new qatar visa ?
yes , as his visa is still active till january , he can come back even if he has any other gcc country visa . but once he will be here definitely the company will ask as how he managed to get the visa but that is not a problem . so your friend can come any time before expiry of the rp . thanks

authentic indian curry
ok ... my son is over here with me at the moment . and he wants to try a real authentic indian curry . back home the curry houses serve british curry , which is awesome and one of my favorite meals , but is different from that served in india -LRB- or so i am told -RRB- . so where should i take him for lunch ?
i know i am bad . and yup i
i know i am bad . and yup i went against the advice . but the theme of the thread still seems to be , that the curry is just as good , if not better in the uk . and back home i live in a sleepy little city that has no thai , no lebanese , and no turkish restaurants . so it 's best to give him food experiences he ca n't get back there .
aryaas is mid
aryaas is mid level ... everyday food at low cost . and it 's mainly veg . but if you are in for a good diniing out experience i would n't chose it . there 's maaza , they do a mean `` kadai chicken '' . there 's asiana , not typical indian food , but it 's ok . then there is shalimar for the banana leaf sadya . their butter chicken is also good .
how is a restaurant called

safron at katara
safron restaurant in katara , doubtless . it might seem expensive compared to other places , but the food and the setting itself are worth the expense .
tb !!!!
the best curry house for me is called spices - round the corner from where we live . they do take out as well as sit in . it is great food .
well ?
did you go or not ?????? what 's the verdict ...
britexpat . . 80 % of the curry
britexpat . . 80 % of the curry houses in the uk are run by bangadeshi . chingari has nice ambient . for value curries qutba in bin dirhem is nice !
brit i have given up on curry
brit i have given up on curry as an idea in qatar . i have decided that it would be better to look for other food experiences for my son while he is here . as the curry back home is better . so we had thai today , and it 's going to be lebanese tomorrow .

what are the big disadvantages living in doha -LRB- as opposed to the uk -RRB- ?
i 'm moving to doha in september and was wondering what things are n't so great about it . hopefully you guys wo n't talk me out of moving !
re : what are the big disadvantages living in doha -LRB- as ...
it is ungreatfull for any body to say all this . you guys have come here not because you did not know the weather , the rules or what ever , the fact is all of us have come here because you earn so much more and you have high saving potential and that is the only thing that brings you here . my friend you also are moving from your home country to doha not for any thing but the money you are offered , and now please understand to gain some thing you defenitely have to sacrifice some thing and i do not know what you sacrifice , but it is all for money you come so just decide what you want . it is meaningless to having such debates on this subject . i am sorry guys , i felt like telling the real fact .
re : what are the big disadvantages living in doha -LRB- as ...
you will always be a slave , as this is their policy here . buy a car ? no , sponsor needed . open a giro bank account ? no , sponsor required . bring your wife ? no , sponsor required . leave for a holiday ? no , sponsor required . and so on and so on . the biggest disadvantage is that water costs twice as much as petrol . you sometimes wish you were a car .
re : what are the big disadvantages living in doha -LRB- as ...
it is drinkable but not advisable .
re : what are the big disadvantages living in doha -LRB- as ...
there are no random shootings or gunmen on the loose .
re : what are the big disadvantages living in doha -LRB- as ...
too bad you are only looking at the dark side , lol . climate would be a disadvantage - it 's really hot right now . but many expats have the ability to leave in the summer . climate is also an advantage - no snow and christmas dinner outside on the patio . i suppose that drinking water can be a problem depending on where you live . i drink the water out of the tap all the time . cars - disadvantages include absolutely insane drivers although it has been getting better . an advantage includes cheap gas and the ability to buy a better vehicle than you probably had at home . social life - disadvantages - you probably will remain within your ethnic group , i 've found it hard to mix and mingle with the qataris . on the other hand , you will make excellent friends and have the time to socialize with them . vacation time - only an advantage here . we have almost triple the vacation time we had at home , the money to go places , and you do n't have to travel as far to go to exotic destinations .
prescription for regular medication
could anyone tell me how i go about getting a prescription for medication that i need to take regularly . i move to doha in 10 days time , i have searched this site but can not seem to find the information i need . thanks louise
re : prescription for regular medication
you should consult a doctor fist and tell him about your medication . he/she will provide you the necessary prescription or advice .
re : prescription for regular medication
sorry for the spelling mistake `` fist '' should be `` first ''
re : prescription for regular medication
you can consult any physicians in any doha clinics , and have yourself examined , then they would write you the prescription that you need ...
re : prescription for regular medication
certain medications are controlled by prescriptions , like anti biotics , steroids and psychatric drugs . most others you can avail over the counter , if the drugs is controlled you need to get a prescription
re : prescription for regular medication
even for controlled drugs ; you ca n't have a permanent prescription , you have to consult your physician everytime -LRB- frequently at least once in 2 months -RRB- to obtain presecriptions for regular medicine .
great add on ql .
any of you gon na sign up ?

mouth ulcer
i am since last 4yrs in doha and suffering with recurrent mouth ulcer . i consulted many doctors here and india but no result.can anyone suggest good doctor for sp.treatment .
re : mouth ulcer
i also had the same problem couple of years back . i would suggest a very good homemade recipie which helped me . first thing in the morning as soon as you get up , squeeze one lime in a glass of warm water add a pinch of salt and drink on empty stomach , do this every morning for at least 15-20 days you 'll start feeling the difference , for the time being apply some jogel gel -LRB- available in any pharmacy -RRB- on the ulcers
re : mouth ulcer
my brother had it before and it was always coming back ... my mom noticed it was induced of a particular food he takes ... so he avoided that food and it is now okey ... there is a powder called alum . . you can place it in the ulcer area ... it will hurt so much that time then it will help cure the area fast ... before i did n't believe because i know that this alum was used cosmetically until one day i was desperate to find a cure and i tried ... and now i am recommending it . .
re : mouth ulcer
why cant ' t people give a straight answer and recommend a good dentist ?? suddenly everyong has a medical degree and giving advices ... the gentleman asked for a good doctor not how to heal his ulcers . pm at your convienience and i will be happy to discuss your condition
re : mouth ulcer
i will try lemon remedy and ya i read about alum is effective on canker sore but alum , omg . thanks for suggestion of all and pm , but still i am searching any answer if anybody suffered and consulted right doctor .
re : mouth ulcer
buy listerine mouthwash . gargle at least 4 times a day . within 2-3 days your mouth ulcer will be cured .
re : mouth ulcer
best and simple answer is drink two glasses of hot water -LRB- equivalent to tea hot -RRB- and drink -LRB- sip by sip like tea -RRB- in the morning empty stomach and in evening after meals before sleep evreyday as long as you can . 100 % effective i was a real sufferer but no more . . try mate ...
re : mouth ulcer
nothing works or it is temporary ... i can bet you all ... drink hot water as hot as tea . . two glasses in morning empty stomach and two glasses in night after dinner ... and feel the difference
re : mouth ulcer
dont know exact soluton , , , but heard that berrygoose is good for this ... avla ... in hindi ... ... just eat them kacha .

any canadian in qatar done his criminal record clearence-cid . ? urgent !!!
i 'm about to transfer my sponcership , and again the problem of cid issue arise . is there a way to prepare the document in qata - or even through kuwait embassy - instead of travelling to canada ?
re : any canadian in qatar done his criminal record ...
i think you can contact the embassy in kuwait and ask them when they are coming to qatar so you can see them . last april i went and to meet them in sheraton hotel to take some letters . or also you can do it with them in kuwait via dhl . sorry if i do n't know .
re : any canadian in qatar done his criminal record ...
police clearance from canada needs to be done from canada through the rcmp and the local police . far as i know this can not be done through the embassy and will take 6 months or so . make sure you actually need this , i was exempted .
re : any canadian in qatar done his criminal record ...
2 years back i tried rcmp and didnt get the reply yet from canada , may i ask what could make someone exempted from obtaining it ? , is that related to company itself , nationality , duration of stay in doha !!!! any help plz
re : any canadian in qatar done his criminal record ...
dear as you are alerady in doha and going to change your sponsorship so you should arrange cid clearence from doha only .
internet control
which is the best software to maintain parent control over internet use by kids . any suggestion please ?
re : internet control
i have a transparent proxy on linux , with squidguard and dansguardian , but that 's a complicated setup .
re : internet control
really , the best way to <i> `` maintain parent control over internet use by kids '' </i> is to browse the web with them . this way you can tell them which site to go or not to go to . plus , you get to spend quality time with them which they -LRB- your kids -RRB- will appreciate later on . i can recommend using <b> opendns </b> if you insist on using an automated way of restricting their web access . just <i> google </i> the word <i> opendns </i> . ...

you can use the properties in internet explorer program to control the internet with your kids without other program .

avg - you can download a full internet security trial for 30 days and then it defaults to the free version which is more than satisfactory ! have been using avg for nearly 10 years now and not a problem - very thorough in keeping those hackers and viruses out ! norton in my humble opinion takes up a lot of computer memory and likes to stick it 's nose in everywhere including your internet browsing ! not to mention expensive ! it came free with my new desktop and i could n't delete it quick enough ! i think it does an all right job with anti-virusing but for me , avg !!! good luck

entry visa process
hi everyone , i 've been accepted for a role at hmc and have been told my entry visa is a 3-8 week process . it 's been almost 8 weeks now and i 'm concerned it will take much longer , especially hearing some of the stories here -LRB- 6 months to get a visa ! -RRB- should i be concerned and expect the process to take much longer ?
. . as i was told . .
. . entry visas may be finished in one day . . that is , if the person doing it has no other things to do . . but , visa issuance to an applicant has so many requirements . . are you sure it is only the visa you 're waiting for . . ? . . have you received a job offer . . ? . . as i previously stated , mine took only a week -LRB- if i remember it right -RRB- . . and then there was a mistake on the name printed . . and then it took them less than a week to have it corrected ...
i have pretty much given them
i have pretty much given them everything they need . i have already been offered the job and signed the contract . i was told they are sorting out my entry visa which is a 3-8 week process , and when this is sorted they would organise my flights to come to doha . so i 'm really not sure how it all works from here ...
individual visa should n't
individual visa should n't take as long . i think if you have already signed the contract then there is nothing to worry about . relax , hmc is not going to cheat you . they might have applied for a bunch of visas , hence the delay . good luck .
thank you for your
thank you for your responses . it has now been over 3 months and is getting very frustrating ! i am being kicked out of my current job because they can no longer afford to keep me here any longer . 3 months for an entry visa and still counting ! i can only imagine what more things i have to do before they will fly me to qatar . is this normal ? every story i hear , it seems the maximum one has to wait is 4 weeks for an entry visa !
which kind of visa did hmc
which kind of visa did hmc applied for ? is it visit ? business ? or working visa ?
chat room for ql : what do you think guys ?
i suggest to update the website of ql to have a chatroom to get an answer or comments immediately on the room who ever are signed in ... to get faster response to those who are asking questions/help/opinions , etc , right ? anyway , it 's only a suggestion , but i hope it would be a good idea for the web master and hopefully to see the room later ... hehehe ... yahoooo !!!! what do you think guys ?

1 yes , 1 no . ask your embassy for the correct answer .

yes , if you have existing visa on other country . no , if you do n't have work visa/residence permit to your destination . if your visa is visit , your passport should valid within 6 months .

why not marry again n then
why not marry again n then sponsor
you can . the daughter is
you can . the daughter is always under the father 's sponsorship until she gets married -LRB- even if she is 50 years old -RRB- !
father can sponsor for sure .
father can sponsor for sure . anyways why ask these things in ql ???? you can directly apply the visa and know the outcome for yourself ??? am i wrong ????
offcourse father can sponsor
offcourse father can sponsor -LRB- resident permit -RRB- for his daughter but he needs to have a family status in qatar and if the daughter is unmarried and dependent on father then it is easy to sponsor . for visit visas no issues .
thank you all for your kind reply . .

exit permits also shows your name , qid , nationality etc. and not destination .

onece you got the exit permit , you are free to go anywhere outside qatar
re : exit permit
as per new way of issuing exit permit it is not mentioned any destination . it used to be mentioned almost 2 yrs ago . need to exit qatar thats all .
re : exit permit
exit visa means you have non obligation towards any body in country you are gon na to exit & free to go any where the person 's wants . it is issued in a name with visa number on which person come entrie the country . -LRB- without showing any destination where she or he is going -RRB-
which gps is good ?

it is . .
i think you can get it in 990 qr from anywhere ... but check it should have a 4gb sd card included and 1 year warranty !!! if you want from me ... i just got it this month , i will give big discount . :-RRB- adeel ali
buy nokia 500
get a nokia 500 , as it is cheap now with free 4gb sd card , it can play mp3 and videos . you can unlock it to install igo , garmin , tomtom and many others and it works great with all of them . if you unlock it , your life will be easy and you will also be able to play divx movies on it !!!

gps ...
samsung omnia ... is very good since it comes with a touch screen as all navigation hardware should be ... it also has 5mp camera !!! the best thing about mobile phone gps is you can install other gps software other than the company provided gps free gps softwares are google maps & nav4all but garmin has the best `` looking '' software although all the info provided are the same !!! the free software do not provide voice assistance & do the route plan . free gps software : 1 . shows where you are in real time . 2 . shows your destination . so the only thing missing is the voice assistance . route planning is hardly required ... . unless you plan to travel into the desert alone . buying garmin gps software cost $ 200 ... almost a third the price of an entry level gps phone . doesnt make sense to buy it when there are free software !
jackmohan , i disagree
jackmohan , i disagree 100 % the screen size on a mobile phone is just too small to be useful as a vehicle gps where you need 100 % concentration on the road without leaning forward to see which way you are going on a 1.5 inch lcd ! yeah , probaly fine as a back up for walking once you leave your car , but for driving , buy the right tool for the job ! <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/b_2_d/3262305312/" title="monotone mia by baldrick2dogs, on flickr"> <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3389/3262305312_f781590578_m.jpg" width="240" height="97" alt="monotone mia" /> </a>
garmin
i had been using all the series of garmin . its all good with different features with each series . gamin nuvi is the model for automobile navigation . nuvi 200 series - 205 , 205e ... . nuvi 300 series - 350 , 360 ... . nuvi 500 series nuvi 600 series - this has a flip antenna unlike other nuvis nuvi 700 series expensive of other series with lane direction and 3d building maps -LRB- useful in europe and us -RRB- . so the middle east map version 5 2008 costs 550 riyals with the garmin dealer . except the nuvi 205w series all other gaming comes with either europe or us maps pre loaded as compliment . nuvi 205w series costs 950 riyals comes with arabic middle east maps as preloaded map . i can be contacted if you want english middle east maps . again if you choose to buy nuvi 205w , you dont need to buy the middle east map additional . all the best .
a gps is only as good as the
a gps is only as good as the map data it has on it or that u can download .

anti-bachelor day
last eid i was shooed away from the corniche and prohibited entry to malls coz i am single . does anyone know what the anti-bachelor days/timings are during this holidays ?
re : anti-bachelor day
darude ... thanks for the wrong info ... city center was on family day ... corniche there was no police , but cid operatives were there ... but i haven ' check villagio and the other malls ... ___ well actually this is not anti-bachelors day ... it may be better called as anti-asian bachelors day ... ____
re : anti-bachelor day
i just returned from villagio . they rejected some `` smelly , poorly dressed '' singles . yes .
re : anti-bachelor day
magic . . its ok if they did not allowed smelly people inside ... but for the so called `` poorly dressed '' singles , what do u mean ? . . maybe thats the only thing that they can afford . . remember , not everybody here in doha is earning that much to spend on fancy clothes . . the thing is , during these mall family days , mall authorities are `` profiling '' single people . . not all bchelors are restricted ... i know you know what i mean .
re : anti-bachelor day
its very true discrimination is rife here in qatar and its a shame because its these very people that keep this country functioning . . i myself have been challenged once on the numerous family days i have entered during to which i replied i am meeting my wife and was let in immediately .
re : anti-bachelor day
sad , but it 's happening in doha ... just go to the mall in good clothes and pray that the guards will let you in ... good luck ...
re : anti-bachelor day
huh ? is it true ? because i want to go malling and watch movies ...
re : anti-bachelor day
no its open for all . i just came from corniche there were no police petrol around and all the bachelors were having good time.but the police might get in the evening
re : anti-bachelor day
i read in the paper a few months back that their definition of a bachelor was and i quote '' a smelly poorly dressed single man '' i saved the article cause i could believe it actually said that . the best thing i would suggest is buy a small child 's coat and bring it with you when they stop you say you had to run out and get your kid 's , who is in the mall with their mother , coat .
penalty for returm checks ?
hi i would like to ask if anyone knows how much is the penalty of a returned checks ? thanks
re : penalty for returm checks ?
i think its qr300
re : penalty for returm checks ?
it is 500 and when the person or company you issued the cheque to will file police complain , it will be on your record and you can not leave doha and you have to submit yourself to the court with all the evidences from the person or company that you have already settled your due .
re : penalty for returm checks ?
it varies from bank to bank . . from 100qr to 500qr ... which bank are you dealing with ??
re : penalty for returm checks ?
i thought it was jail time . is n't it illegal to issue a cheque knowing you do n't have the funds to honour it ?

re : return ticket required for the family visit visa ?
yes , return ticket is required to show at immigration section in your country itself
re : return ticket required for the family visit visa ?
not to enter into qatar . maybe to leave ur home country as jotish said , but once in qatar , it 's not needed , not even to extend the visit visa to up to 6 months , u wo n't need it . do n't forget , in case u want to extend the visit visa , to make the blood and x-ray , than the extension procedure before , 26th of february . may they have a nice stay .
re : return ticket required for the family visit visa ?
no return ticket is needed for residency visit visa -LRB- once again you make it sure with ticket booking agency - ie akabar/riya or what ever -RRB- for your mother return ticket is necessary
re : return ticket required for the family visit visa ?
dear if it is visit visa return ticket will b necessary for them to come out their country and also to come in to this country . even if u go to buy them ticket they wont give u one way as its visit visa n nt residence visa . . so the better choice if u have a friend working in any agency like etihad or anything try to ask him to provide u two ways ticket then u will pay only one ticket and other ticket will be canceled once ure family reach qatar i mean u will call him n ask him to cancel it once they r here . thats wht my husband did for me . . hope this answer wil help u out . . wish nice trip for ure family .
re : return ticket required for the family visit visa ?
no . visit visa do not need tickets . neither one way nor return . i always get my visitors visa first , than tell them to book their flight . visit visa do not require tickets . now to come to qatar by plane , u need tickets , if by land or sea , donno !!!
re : return ticket required for the family visit visa ?
i meant family visit visa do not require tickets . not visit visa .
re : return ticket required for the family visit visa ?
thanks for your replies . . my family reached here safely . only visit visas require the return ticket , family visa does n't require the return ticket . .

no !
talk to him in a polite manner and request that you want to have a final exit . draft a resignation letter and goto him and request in a kind manner and take his signatory on it , once everything is done then no one can stop you , if you still face any problems then goto hrd and raise them your concerns .
who is your sponsor ? go talk

can i have a lot of shipment from china to qatar ?
i am planning to order a lot of items from an online shop located in china , for example shoes , dresses , accesorries , they will ship it via fedex or aramex is there any problem with the customs ?
re : can i have a lot of shipment from china to qatar ?
they will ship it via `` aramex '' ... hummmmm so strange since to my understanding aramex serves via uk and us -LRB- only -RRB- on the other hand , i will have to agree with the above poster : do you have an import/trading license ?? ... no ?? then `` a lot of things will be seized by the authorities '' regards !!
re : can i have a lot of shipment from china to qatar ?
just about to write the same as polkadots ... do you trust the seller/dealer ?? regards !!
re : can i have a lot of shipment from china to qatar ?
i think you can do this , but not order too much . then it will be as if your doing business . so then you need a license . my friend was ordering sometimes personal stuff for him from china .
re : can i have a lot of shipment from china to qatar ?
yes you can . . i did this without question at all as long they are not the same item as long they are for personal/gift item as long they are not radio equipment such us transmitter or receiver . if as what you mentioned they are just apparels and it is from china you wont be having a problem with the custom even they are 20 items . and yes china does use the aramex courier as well .
re : can i have a lot of shipment from china to qatar ?
thank you all , for the great responses . . ^ ^
cheapest rental car for one month
i am looking for the cheapest rental car -LRB- personal use not through a company -RRB- for one month . the lowest i have found so far is 1700 which is pretty good but anyone know of anything lower ???
re : cheapest rental car for one month
hey . 1700 is pretty good-but it depends on what car you 're looking for . im also renting a car at the moment but looking to buy one very soon as it works out much cheaper ! also , if you get in an accident - the car has insurance , but from what i 've seen - the car rental companies require you to pay 2,500 - even its not your fault . furthermore , the insurance will not cover everything , and you may have to pay an additional amount . please be careful : -RRB-

cayenne servicing and repairs
hi my husband is trying to buy a 4yr old cayenne s but i am worried about the costs of servicing and repair as my father had one in dubai and the main dealer was very expensive until we found a good private guy - there arre many in dubai . are there smaller private mechanics who specialize in porsche here in doha . has anyone had a good experience and can recommend ? please help my sad husband because otherwise its a no no ! lol .
cayenne s
no worry just call the porsche service centre and check with some mechanics or with the supervisor - they will know who is best in private to do the work of such expensive vechiles
thanks for you comments
it a 2006 i think but i know it has no warranty . i am not sure but trouble is husband likes it but it is a family decision . i like them but know in dubai my friends and family all use private guys and are happy but dubai is a lot bigger and we have many special mechanics - we just do n't know any places yet in doha . i guess i could try salwa rd but where ?

qadoomy , you just said : `` you spoke about indians/pinoys/etc are present here more than westerners , but i tell you that they dnt have any influence on most ppl , as they dnt target us with their movies , songs , etc. if you think i speak about westerners invading qatar , then you are wrong , i mean u invaded the whole arabic world . please do not take it personal as i dnt hate or target the western citizens as ppl , but ur governments , media , etc. '' they do n't have an influence ? yes they do , the food , the clothing , the manners , especially when the qataris are a minority in their own country . this is more of the old rotten speech , they hate the west , they hate what they are but they want what they have .

also , arabic is one of the
also , arabic is one of the languages in the un council and probably its going to stay as long as the arab world remains a major crude and petroleum supplier to the world .
we have to admit that arabs
we have to admit that arabs are not using their language as before as we are being invaded by the western culture -LRB- that comes in forms of tv channels , movies , sports , technology , etc. -RRB- however , arabic is the language of the most read and most memorized book by heart on earth , which is the holy qura ` n. now all over the world there are millions of people that memorize this book by heart in it 's original language - arabic . so the only way to eliminate the usage of arabic is to get rid of the 1.5 billion muslims around the world ... that thing distinguishes us from the romans and from the latin language ... so i can say to the romans : `` in yo ' face '' : -RRB-
sorry doha knight
arabic is not going to die as long as the holy quran remains , islam is the fastest religion in the world . there is story of guy who wrote about western tourist , going down into journy into depth of earth . long story to cut short , when the decide to go back , they want to leave a message there , as mark of them being here . so they choose -LRB- he the writer -RRB- to write in arabic . when the author was asked by press , he said because arabic language is going to stay as long as their there is holy quran , and it is langauge of the future.and i say ineeded it , what if all muslims countries united , we will be more powerfull than america . look to europe , when they knew why usa is stronger than economcly and militray , they decied to make union to catch with usa , which is like different countries united with each other .
abdira , did i ever say arabic
abdira , did i ever say arabic was going to die ? i was talking about its use in the un council .
arabic will never die , its
arabic will never die , its only a temporary period where there are a lot of non-arabs living in gcc and that is the reason for the spread of english -LRB- which is supposed to be the international language -RRB- , in the future when the construction boom will end in the gcc the arabic language will return to its outstanding position . qatari government has made a very good steps to avoid the loss of the language so most of the legal transaction has to be in arabic and many formal departments are dealing in arabic only . the above is only the social part , and the religious part is greater as for every muslim the arabic language is necessary coz it is the language of the holy qur ` an and learning at least a few words is must for them .
mt : why u tried to learn
mt : why u tried to learn arabic although ur english is the international language and everybody wants to learn it !? 1 - u think that it will be an advantage learning other language regardless whatever it is . 2 - u think that arabic is some special language and worth to learn it . 3 - the circumstances around u made u learn it . 4 - some other reason .
i learned it because i have
i learned it because i have arabic friends who i go to visit and their families do n't know much english , so sometimes they speak and i dont understand . it is tiring for my friend to always try and translate to me . also , i really like the arabic language and would like to know it just so i know what local people and other arabic people are saying when they are either communicating to me or about me .
good 4 u mt , this is nice of
good 4 u mt , this is nice of u , in fact for me working in a construction company with many indians around me makes me feel that i should learn hindi and i did not coz i like that language but coz i feel that i have to learn it to make my life easier . so my point is that sometimes u will be in a situation which will force u to learn a language of others and that will benefit them in the end and same is happening for arabic in qatar coz u should know arabic if u want to easily get into formal dept. and that will prevent the death of the language .
true that many people who
true that many people who memorize qura 'n does not totally get what they memorize however lot of the `` quran people '' go into quran studies , learn the arabic language , and become better arabic speakers than arabs themselves . you ca n't say arabic is the language of allah , but it is the language of qura ` n. . . also i just wanted to clarify a thing ... there is no english version of the qura 'n to become more spread and popular than the qura 'n we have , since qura 'n is persevered in arabic , while having side explanations in what ever language . it 's not like the bible where it was translated to tons of languages , the content of quran is preserved in arabic , the explanation or say interpretation can be written in other languages . this is done so we keep the qura 'n change-free book , and not have tens or even hundreds of `` holy-books '' that contradict with each-other and each one has a meaning of itself ... we avoided what happened to our fellow christians , thats why every muslim can be proud when saying there is one holy book which is the qura 'n : -RRB-
there is a major difference .

i guess that what qadoomi is
i guess that what qadoomi is trying to say is `` there is no english version of qur ` an '' but there is `` english translation '' which shows the meaning of the same , and which can vary from translator to other but the arabic version is the base for all which ca n't vary or change .

change is the law of nature .
no , arabic is going to

there has been much concern about the health of today 's american trucker . especially within the ranks of the truckers themselves . trucker health is at the top of the agenda at the federal motor carrier safety administration and they are very concerned about driver 's health . and with the rise in diabetes , high blood pressure and sleep apnea in drivers there is good reason . <a href="http://www.vaninsured.com"> http://www.vaninsured.com </a>

exit permit hurdle , need your advice .
its been eight months since i am working in a private -LRB- small -RRB- company . since my sister is not well , i want to go urgently on at least a 10-day emergency leave , but my sponsor is refusing exit permit . please advise what to do ?
re : exit permit hurdle , need your advice .
you could go to the human rights committee but that could take months and is not guranteed . your sponsor has you by the balls i 'm afraid ...
re : exit permit hurdle , need your advice .
is there any specific reason why your sponsor refuse to give you permit ? i think if you have good reason they will allow . speak with them once again before you take this issue to labour department .
re : exit permit hurdle , need your advice .
i can see no reason why your employer will refrain from giving you an exit permit . . however just make sure the following before filing a complaint \ ; 1 . make sure that they approved your emergency or vacation leave . 2 . just make sure that your mandoob secures it honestly good luck
re : exit permit hurdle , need your advice .
give some proof that u will come back , sponser will win in the court , not adviceable , request him once more

pet cheetah
does anybody know how to contact the guy who drives around doha in a suv with his pet cheetah in the passenger seat ?
epicurean : you must be new
epicurean : you must be new here . i guess i thought it was more than one guy . anyway , i saw a guy cruising around with a cheetah riding shotgun at the port of doha .
saw it too ...

in case you find his contacts
in case you find his contacts please post it here so that i can get a pic with the cheetah : -RRB-
let 's see what they think of
let 's see what they think of him when the cheetah mauls him on the face one day ...
it is not illegal here in qatar
and its not just one guy . there are many . you need to get a license from the concerned department and you can keep one . getting the license is not that easy !!! i know an expat staying in al khor who is trying hard to get the license .
actually , jfast_jfurious ... it is highly illegal here ...
the person handing out licences is thwarting decades old trade embargoes in cheetahs , an endangered specises ... who exactly is regulating this ? not this person who is handing out licences ... if he was ... he 'd know that every person with a cheetah in their vehicle is violating the first law of owning a wild animal ... and that is putting the lives of bystanders in danger ... may he soon be dealt with accordingly ...
xena ... why a child ? the child
xena ... why a child ? the child is innocent . why not let the cheetah maul its owner !
hehehe i know the guy . you
hehehe i know the guy . you wan na call the cites office to confiscate his cheetah ?? loool this particular guy can get you , your family , your friends , your friends ' friends deported in 12 hours from doha if he wants . plus he has license for his cheetah and is about to own a white tiger soon . really cool guy though . i can give you his phone number if you insist ... it is a very easy number too heheh ; -RRB-
cheetah
if you find his details - let me know please . then i 'll report him to the cites office so they can confiscate the poor cheetah and get it into a proper sanctuary for wild animals .
not this again ... dejavu
not this again ... dejavu http://www.qatarliving.com/node/845976 wonder if it 's a leopard or a cheetah or the both are out there ...

while i was in the bus going
while i was in the bus going to uni in a nice sunny day in brighton i was reading the famous metro newspaper and was shocked by this article , http://www.metro.co.uk/news/802402-police-knew-john-paul-masseys-home-was-breeding-den-for-dogs to me i would say wild animals with their teeth out are safer than any dog alive , and god bless all cheetahs and some dogs specially huskies -LRB- i like them i always do -RRB- post some pictures of your dogs and maybe i will edit my comment and add your dogs breeds : p
bo-jassim
right ... and you do n't find removing the teeth of a wild animal just so someone can have it as a show-piece pet inhumane ?
its better than keeping them
its better than keeping them in cages in the zoo or i am wrong ? we let someone to take care of them dont worry about that just try to feed your dogs and keep them alive . some people buy dogs and dont have money to feed them so . . close conversation .
bo-jassim
i 'm afraid i disagree . keeping wild animals as pets is just as cruel as keeping them in a zoo . at least in a zoo they may be kept by professionals who actually know how to keep them , be fed a proper diet and have the chance to live in social groups . people who parade them round as pets rarely feed them the right diet , do n't allow them to behave naturally and then wonder why the animal turns and attacks them .
i am still stuck on the
i am still stuck on the mental image of seeing a cheetah on a leash walking through the lobby of the w. sorry , i 'm afraid my baser instincts would gain ascendancy and i would gawp like a rubber-necker at an accident . the small-town kid in me would go , `` oh , my god , that is so cool ! '' my bad . mandi

i took down this douche 's
i took down this douche 's license plate ages ago and tried to report it , i was told to bugger off and mind my own business unless i wanted a one way ticket out of here . this guy is untouchable , he does have a license for the animal , and i was told -LRB- but i 'm not sure if it 's true -RRB- that he actually rescued the animal from a `` friend '' in saudi , who was keeping it in a tiny cage , and that the animal ca n't stand to be kept in a cage and is `` afraid '' to leave it 's owners side . sounds like horseshit to me , but hey , i was told to shut up .
quagmire
how long have you lived in qatar now just out of interest ? telling us to `` level down if we want to earn a living '' is a joke . do n't insult me by trying to tell me how to live . i 've been a part of animal welfare in qatar for years now and the `` he 'll get you deported '' card just does n't work anymore . qaws reports people for a whole number of violations all the time . every license plate number , mobile number & photo gets delivered to the necessary authorities , whether it be someone driving around with a doped up cheetah , a pet shop selling illegal animals or someone whose stolen a dog . if it does n't get any further than that then at least we 've tried to help the animal by bringing it to the attention of the authorities . i 'm sure he has a license . anyone with the right family name can get one . and i 'm sure he treats it as well as he thinks it should be treated . but i doubt it 's enough . having a piece of paper does n't mean it 's morally right to own a big cat , rip it 's claws out , take it 's teeth out , drug it to the eyeballs and parade it round in public places like some people do . it does n't give you permission to put the lives of hundreds of people in danger by taking your big cat to a crowded car park and getting it out to pose with . having a license still does n't mean they are regulated by the authorities or have their facilities checked . there are people here with wild animals with so called `` licenses '' that do n't take care of them . go to any vet and ask them how many sick and dying cheetah cubs they see every year because they 're not looked after . i 'm sure he is a nice guy . i just think he sees his cheetah more of a status symbol then a dangerous wild animal .
saw him once
me and my friend is arguing what type of animal was that ... but i think and told her it was a cheetah !!! i find it so cooollll !!!
chelsea
with whom have you complained about the condition of the animals in the zoo ?
tcom
the animals at the zoo fall under the ministry of environment and any complaints go straight there . we 've worked with the zoo directly trying to get enrichment programs in place for the animals but they do n't ever follow them . the zoo has a tiny budget and the head vet there is a great guy who has huge ideas on how to improve everything but none of his superiors will authorise the budget to do so . the zoo keepers have no training and are just cleaners who do n't care about the animals at all . we 're trying to get as many people as possible to take photos and submit them with a letter of complaint to the ministry of enviroment to try and get them to see how bad it is . the same goes for the pet shops and souq waqif as well .
quagmire
a solely chicken diet wo n't be good for him . assuming he is a 40kg cheetah , he should be having around 2200 - 2500 kcal 6 days a week with supplemented vitamins and calcium . he should be getting a commercial big cat feed daily with chicken/meat added once or twice a week as well as the supplements .
4 weeks old and potty
4 weeks old and potty trained ... . there is something wrong here !
sorry i misunderstood proxy
sorry i misunderstood proxy just like you misunderstood everything i am saying . so if it happens that i know a friend with a cheetah and if it also happens that i am telling people that this guy got some power to own a licensed cheetah , then i am a suck up . wow . . i just hope you do not apply this logic in your daily life . if you are at this stage of life , then maybe it is time to go live in a nicer place uk boy ? unless if you really like it here , which would point out your severely bad lifestyle taste . you are not at the stage yet brother , wake up and stop swimming in your own piss .
someone please explain ... can
someone please explain ... can a wild animal like cheetah be potty trained before 4 weeks of age . do n't you find it a bit fishy ? i think the ad is a bit exaggerated !
no wonder the falcon was
no wonder the falcon was trained to fly back to the original seller ! @ next time around he will sell it for 100,000 usd ... ... sucker ! ~
quite so joa ... you are
quite so joa ... you are right ! cat 's do n't use a toilet ! dogs do if they are trained to do so !

sick as in awesome . . sorry my bad hehe but really , why do you guys like to put your nose into everything and anything ? i mean the guy likes wild pets , he can afford having them and feeding them and allowing them space to run . . what is wrong in this ? i understand if it is causing danger to others or him starving it . . why do actors in hollywood are allowed having wild animals ? if everyone minds their own business the world would be amazing

common sense gkramer , liking
common sense gkramer , liking wild animals is not equivalent to liking cocaine . but if you really do , you should go ahead and do it . . u live once buddy ... just do it where it is allowed . .
quagmire
cheetahs can be owned privately . if they are respected . but they are not . if someone wanted to own a big cat , gave it a specially designed enclosure which satisfied all of it 's natural behaviours , fed it a natural diet , treated it with respect and had strict safety proceedures in place for all aspects of owning the cat and be properly regulated with all the correct licenses and documents -LRB- not just buying a license from a friend -RRB- then so be it . we do n't like it but at least it 's well looked after . but having it on a collar and lead in a public place , with little respect for it 's power , keeping it in a barren cage in the garden , not feeding it the right diet , de-clawing , drugging and de-fanging it - it 's not on . we are here to educate people on all aspects of animal welfare including wild and endangered animals . qaws is a member of the species survival network -LRB- ssn -RRB- which works alongside cites to regulate endangered animals , which a cheetah is . leaving a cheetah locked in a landcruiser in the underground car park of landmark shopping mall with no a/c and no windows cracked ... that 's just animal cruelty .

so far the cheetahs and all
so far the cheetahs and all the other wild animals kept here have not mauled anyone , but that is only because they are drugged into oblivion , thing is they get used to it . . and then ... bloodbath .

he 's got a phantom and one of the only very few rs6s ... he is not an idiot chelsea , not that i agree to owning a wild animal . but to each of us the things we like in life . his cheetah is sick and very friendly tho ... scary when you see it but as friendly as a dog .
deportation
many times we 've been threatened with deportation over the years because we 're `` interfering '' . normally it means the person is doing something illegal/morally wrong and they know they 've been caught .
ah yes , i heard he was to get
ah yes , i heard he was to get a new pet ...

how can i go back in qatar when my new passport is renewed and change my family name ?
when you go home to get merried and you wanted to change your passport in your country so your marital status and family name will be change , is it possible to go back in qatar when your visa name is now different from the new passport that is issued to you though you attached the old passport ?
re : how can i go back in qatar when my new passport is ...
yep attach your old passport with a valid rp and you can come into qatar , then you need a letter from your embassy for changing name and you can change your name of the rp .
re : how can i go back in qatar when my new passport is ...
thanks so much for the advice ... i am just confuse a little about the letter , shall i get this in my embassy here in qatar once i come back ? or i could get this letter from my home country at the same time while im processing my new passport ? god bless to all of you ! thanks again ! : -RRB-

permanent residence for parents
dear all , i heard that permanent residence for parents is possible now for a fee of qar 2,500 . i just want someone here to confirm this before i go to imiigration and embarass myself . my mother is 59 years old and i am looking to sponsor her . she is totally dependent on me . she recently went back after staying for six months . i guess anyone working at the immigration department might help .
you heard ?? from where ?? name the source !!
so far and to my knowledge this is not allowed in the immigration scheme actually presenet in qatar . maybe the source from which you heard is trying to make some easy money and then leave a `` big trouble '' behind . only wife and kids can get rp . and by the way nothing has been officially notified by immigration neither in the newspapers nor in any of the government related websites . regards !!
one of my friends went to the
one of my friends went to the immigration department for visa extension of his parents . the guys filling out the form asked him whether this is for permanent residence or temporary . i know there is no official annoucement but you never know in this country .
agents question . .

saudi
my uncle stays in riyadh saudi arabia with his family and my grandmother also stays with him on a permanent residence since she was 70 . now she is 86 and still staying with them . my uncle is the only son and since my grandfather is no more , where would an old woman stay ? i think if you have a proper justification , you can sponsor your parents . .

other comments are right ... you may find a part timer but not a full time maid . check with the recruiting agency to sponsor one is the best option .

that 's what my boyfriend
that 's what my boyfriend says too exiledsaint . :p actaully the women i know with lots of cats all have husbands or long term boyfriends . i think the spinster with cats thing is a myth/stereotype .
i remember this rough
i remember this rough american constuction guy once and he applied to one of those russian dating sites back in the 90s when lots of ladies were looking to get out of russia . however he could not understand why all the pictures the agency sent him where of women surrounded by cats . we checked his application form and under interests he wrote pussy . now obviously the russians translated this and decided that he must have been a cat lover ...
no , it 's not pathetic ! you
no , it 's not pathetic ! you are a loving and giving woman who wants to open her heart to yet another poor orphan . it 's wonderful . mandi

ok things to consider . -LRB- the list is not exhausted -RRB- 1 . cost . cost of food , vacination , and other vets expenses and kennel costs when going away on holiday . 2 . time , do you have time to take care of them or are you expecting that they take care of themselves , like cleaning the litter bin , making sure that they have food etc and have some time to spend with them . 3 . welfare , are the cats going be locked in all the time ? are they going to be let out ? ----------------- he who dares wins

ok so there 's no physical
ok so there 's no physical reason why you can not have the 3rd cat . from what i can tell , you 're indecisiveness does not come from the fact that you think 3 cats are too many , it comes from the fact that you think 3 cats may lead you to more cats , and thus the crazy cat lady syndrome . rest assured , that when you have 3 cats , you will really only have 3 cats . extra cats will not magically appear no matter how much you worry you will fall into the temptation to have more cats . if you are worried now that 4 or 5 cats are beyond your limit , then i can safely say that the worry will not disperse in your sleep over night , and you will not be forced to watch your feet as they uncontrollably lead you into the cat shelter and pick out another kitty to add to your already full household . i can promise you , your thought processes will still be intact after 3 cats , and even if you want more , you will be able to weigh the consequences and decide against another one , no matter how cute the face staring at you is .

listen man , in the us you can now schedule a visit to the moon if you pay enough money . can you do it in doha ? yes it is very funny what you asked . try telling the rental company you will take their bike to the track and even the receptionist will laugh at your silly ars . u need special insurances & proof of racing experience , and in a place like doha , good luck having a company go an extra step for these processes ! plus of course enough demand for the rental business to survive after renting for a 0.1 % population of bike racers with no bikes . good luck though , tell them in uk they do it if they object .

termination of service with bank loan remaining
i work in a government organisation under ministry of defence . i had 90000 riyal loan from qib . i have some trouble at my work . they are planning to end my services . i want to ask if suppose they terminate me , what will the bank do in order to in order to get its payment back ?
re : termination of service with bank loan remaining
company will transfer all your end of service and final settlement of salary to your bank a/c . and will give a notice to bank you are terminated from job . so the bank will freeze your account and transfer the proceeds to loan settlement .
re : termination of service with bank loan remaining
if u r not having money to pay pls tell them to take the car and close the account , or give the for sale at qatar living and if sold fopr a good price pls close the loan and give the car to the new person . if u are in doubt pls start doing now itself
re : termination of service with bank loan remaining
but what will happen to the balance loan amount , which will be there after all money recovered by way of final settlement , freezing of a/c will the bank allow him to leave the country with unpaid loan ???
re : termination of service with bank loan remaining
the sponsor will not cancel the rp until receiving a bank letter stating that there are no outstanding liabilities . so if you owe money on a loan you ca n't leave until its is settled . best to borrow money from friends/family to pay it off , or you might get arrested for being a loan defaulter . there is nothing you can do to avoid paying back the money .
re : termination of service with bank loan remaining
in our company there was same situation with one person . . he was terminated from his job ... then he ask for noc because he have no money to pay for loan . and he got noc now he is doing job in another company and also he paying his loan also every month .
re : termination of service with bank loan remaining
what about the fees which i payed for insurance while taking the loan . will not they help something by paying the remaining amount to the bank .

ruckus in corniche
this friday when we went to corniche there were trails of cars waving some checkered flags and driving at crazy speeds and creating lot of problem to people by stopping the cars in between the roads and hopping in to other car . does anyone no what all this ruckus was all about . the traffic police really had a tough time controlling all this .
for the last 28 years , i
for the last 28 years , i just did n't understand what kind of celeberation way is this by creating so much trouble for other commuters & police . they will shout like animals , make loud engine noises , burn their tyres . they do n't realize that may be there might be a patient behind them who needs medical attention or has somekind of pain in his ears by hearing loud voices etc. . sadly speaking -LSB- no offense -RSB- , they are qatari youths mostly . i wonder whether they give any alms or donations in the name of allah if they get any happiness or victory in their failed but at the same time very popular game football . . they just proof themselves as one of the most ignorant people on earth as they just do n't care for others . _______________________________________________________ ***** / / / you remind me of my next girlfriend / / / *****
actually there celebration
actually there celebration reminds me of biker gangs in us . and when you see them you do the exact same two things no matter where you are . 1 -RRB- ignore them , 2 -RRB- back in your mind you say ... idiots
i like it when qatar win the
i like it when qatar win the football , it makes me feel part of a proud country . that said , i do n't live in doha and it 's a bit different to have a few people roaring round dukhan waving flags and hooting . if i was on the corniche at that time it would have probably been different . i have had to wait before on the fast road to shahhania as 2 cars have blocked the road to have a chat !
it is their way of
it is their way of celebrating the weekend or some even like football etc. and i absolutley do n't find anything wrong with it . usually there is a huge trail of vehicles honking and blinking musically and the timing they choose is always after 11.30 pm . so , it is certainly not a office timing . and if they encounter an ambulance they give it a way , i have observed it personally . even once our own car was clinched among them somewhere near mall r/a and they stayed behind us and gave us a way . there are different ways people celebrate their weekends , some drink , dine and date . what is wrong if some people chose driving as their way to enjoy ? everything gon na be alright !!!
they are qatari youths
yah they are qatari so what is your problem they are celibrating they dont disturb other country so pls . live them alone they are in their own country .

but siddh , they normally do
but siddh , they normally do it only once a week and that too on late friday nights is what i have observed . is there any harm in it ? the traffic moves more slowly for say 10-15 mins but come on , it is not office time . rather than a ` vulgar display of wealth ' i feel it is their way of relaxing on a weekend . as long as they do n't harm anybody i feel its o.k. they are just having a nice time . well , i wish to join the convoy sometime just for fun ... :-RRB- everything gon na be alright !!!
shreeya - think this way : -
shreeya - think this way : - relaxing on public property ? is it normal ? - disrupting traffic by stopping cars on the road , speeding etc. for relaxing . is it sane ? - you compared drink , dine & date with road rage ... the difference is clear between privately celebrating or showing off publicly ? watch this video ... another kind of ` relaxing ' http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjupndikkek maybe future of qatar ? lol !

choice of suv
we are looking at buying a suv and are considering the following options within our budget.our options are 1 . toyota prado 2012 2 . mitsubishi pajero 2012 3 . nissan armada 2012 please help us make an informed choice .
re : choice of suv
in your list , armada would be the favorite although prado is not too bad either . but if you want the bestest suv of all among the japanese models , then my view is that it is the nissan patrol . on the other hand if you want to buy a good suv but still want to be green and go easy on the environment : then buy either a prado with 2.7 litre engine or a toyota fortuner with the same 2.7 litre engine . the 2.7 engine in the fortuner is cool on fuel and the car is a reasonably sturdy 4x4 and 7 seater .
re : choice of suv
armada ? is n't that in a different class to the other 2 ? armada has a 5.6 v8 engine and is more suitable for a family car that only goes to the sand -LRB- beach , dunes , etc. -RRB- rarely or lightly . the prado and pajero both offer v6 engines with good -LRB- if not very good -RRB- off-road capabilities . the i4 prado is not considered good due to lack of power . both these v6 cars are quite reliable too -LRB- i do n't know enough about the armada , though -RRB- and can carry up to 7 people with the driver . maintenance wise , toyota and nissan can be difficult due to the long queue at their service stations . otherwise , you can try your luck with non-dealership service workshops . i 'm sure there are a lot of good ones out there that can work on these three models . you can head to driverarabia dot com for more info on most cars .
re : choice of suv
re choice of suv prado > pajero > armada ! toyota prado 2012 - the txl scores over vx ` cos you can always get aftermarket gps whachamacallit to spruce up your prado txl . upper spec trims may be a waste of $ $ $ . mitsubishi pajero 2012 - the 3.8 271 hp ranks higher over other pajero variants and when compared against prado & armada , the pajero may appear ` dated ' nissan armada 2012 - v8 beast , gas guzzler !

best gynec and hospital ?
hi , i would like to know the female gynecs in qatar -LRB- preferablly keralites or someone who understands malayalam or atleast from india -RRB- would like to know who are the best gynecs amoung them ... i have some small issues so i am looking for experienced and good gynecs . thanks , .
re : best gynec and hospital ?
i suggest you al-ahli hospital dr , sujatha
re : best gynec and hospital ?
khudsia begum , hema rajeev -LRB- alraffa -RRB- etc
re : best gynec and hospital ?
what elegance has suggested , it 's absolutely right . . dr.khudsia is highly recommended one in doha . . however , you can even pay visit to apollo if u r looking for indian gynaec ... kindly go through the below link . . http://www.qatarliving.com/node/1173008
re : best gynec and hospital ?
khudsia begum and hema rajeev and khudsia begum is also from india -LRB- bangalore -RRB-
re : best gynec and hospital ?
dr. khudsia has a private clinic on al waab street . she is a very good doctor . . although there is a long waiting line outside her clinic even before it opens , so make sure you go early otherwise you 'll have to wait for a looooong time . she does not take phone appointments , so the only option is to go to the clinic and take a number ... another excellent indian doctor is dr. sujatha in al-ahli hospital . . she is south indian , maybe keralite or tamilian -LRB- i 'm not sure -RRB- . . you can make telephonic appointments at the hospital to see her . . she also gives her patients her mobile number in case of any questions or emergency and attends all her calls . . she is really good . . !
re : best gynec and hospital ?
dr.zeenat rizvi is an excellent doctor , who is most experienced than all in qatar and also world renowned doctor -LRB- worked in uk -RRB- . she diagnose each cases uniquely.but getting her appointment is difficult as she is too busy . also dr.hema rajeev -LRB- al rafaa clinic -RRB- is good doctor , she will deal straight forwardly & good decisions given by her .
re : best gynec and hospital ?
dr.zenat rizvi working with al ahli hospital
re : best gynec and hospital ?
<!--break--> yes dr zeenat rizvi is the best in ahli hospital ... . i used to consult her n even dr sujata is good ... ... infact all the doctors in ahli r good ... ... . . dr kudsia is from mangalore ... . . she is very nice n friendly ... the only disadvantage she doesnt take prior appointments so all u have to do is wait ther ... ... i don suggest apollo clinic ... i really had a bad experience ther ... . . nd yes hema rajeev is good in al rafa clinic ... . . but the thing is whn u complete ur 6 months she gives a referral either to ahli or hamad ... ... so its better to go to ahli hospital itself ... . .

i think you are an idiot . well , you did ask ! as to man utd . to the best of my knowledge they have no muslim players , so it 's not really an issue is it ? they were traditionally a catholic team many years back . it was difficult for a protestant to break into the team let alone a non-christian !
avvid
let the muslim player playing the sport decide that for himself , he 's got a mind of his own and you nor me are in a position to dictate what he should or should not wear . so stfu and go to your corner . like the wiseman rizks said , this thread will take an ugly turn !

baldrick you beat me to the idiot comment but ya he is asking for it .
gk . . you jumped the gun and labelled me ...
without bothering the find the details . did i issue the instruction ? no , i just asked the question to find out the opinion of muslims in the gulf . did i insult the religion ? not at all . but yet you choose to come to the defence of the religion -LRB- i hope -RRB- by labelling me an idiot . how am i an idiot ? by seeking to clarify confusion and misunderstanding ? from the views expressed above , it is obivious that not all muslims share the opinion . so obiviously this is a misinterpretation of the religion . and that helps separate religion from the politics and propaganda that cloud it . perhaps you should jump into the gulf . seeing as you 're already jumping to conclusions .
i am very happy with the
i am very happy with the world around me , i ai n't jumping into any gulf ; -RRB-

firstly , i think you 're the one to blame for everyone calling you an idiot . reason being is that you did n't put the source of the article , thereby making everyone think that you 're asking the questions and are out for some religious bashing .

hi to all , i want to know that if my brother calls my hubby on family visit visa for 6 months ... can my hubby do any job here in qatar ... does it effect my brother 's job or anything . . ??? plz help
re : want to know working in 6 month visit visa allow in ...
against the law to work while on a visit visa . if your brother wants to find a job here then he would have to transfer his visa to a working visa or risk getting into trouble .
re : want to know working in 6 month visit visa allow in ...
its problem
re : want to know working in 6 month visit visa allow in ...
well its illegal for anyone to work under a visit visa , but there are many people who still dont mind / care . some employers do employ people on short term basis though it is illegal . if caught both can be fined and ur husband would most probably deported .

re : what is the risk of working without a visa in qatar ?
you will go to police and go out of country
re : what is the risk of working without a visa in qatar ?
if you are working in a hidden place nothing will happen espacially if you stay away of problems . but if you were caught due a problem you did espacailly in resturents or front offices , the interior ppl will throw you out of the country with a band
re : what is the risk of working without a visa in qatar ?
1 . if you need medical assistance it will turn out that you are an outlaw here . postponing to solve the health issues can turn fatal . 2 . once you leave the country you can not come back . . so you are forced to stay here as long as possible if you think the job is worth . .

should i accept this offer
i am a project design engineer in hvac from pakistan having an experience of 4 years . i am being offered a gross salary of 8000 qr by a mep contracting company . i am still negotiating my terms @ 10k qr . need advise from the experienced lot ?? what about family visa in qatar ? how can bring my wife to qatar ? would really appreciate some great advise .
re : should i accept this offer
i would think 9-10k is reasonable as a basic salary for 4 years of experience . however , i do think you need to be paid additional allowances for accommodation , transport etc. also make sure your annual flights and medical insurance are covered . all the best .
re : should i accept this offer
family visa is not a problem . once you come in and complete your residency formalities , you can process your wife 's visa .
re : should i accept this offer
firstly i take it this is 8000 per month ? if so then no do n't accept unless the contractor provides you with housing at the very least . rent in doha is very expensive . the average rent for a 2 bedroom apartment in doha with furniture is at least 6000 qr a month . as for family visa 's i do n't know enough to give you accurate information . but if you have children who are at school then you would also want the contractor to pay tutition fees as school fees are expensive as well .
re : should i accept this offer
if you get the accomodation allowance or comnpany provided accomodation and the medical coverage , then even 8000 qatari riyal is also ok but 10000 qatari riyal will be fair enough for a person with 04 years experience only.it also depends on your family size like for a small family with a kid or no kid even you can survive in one bedroom + 01 sitting room also which may be aorund 4000 qatari riyals fully furnished but for a bigger family it will be very difficult for you to stay on your own as you will need to get a bigger house . arranging the family visa is not a big problem as long as you have salary more than 7000 qatari riyals.best of luck
re : should i accept this offer
thanks all of you , the package includes accommodation by the contractor and pick and drop facility from your house to the site . the timings are from 0600-1800 and six days a week . what are the charges for processing my wife 's visa ?

working visa issuance how long
hello guyz , just wan na ask anyone knows how long is the release of working visa in qatar ? because my agency told me that the already forwarded all my requirements for visa application , but until now no feedback from qatar embassy . its almost 40days today . i do hope someone can answer my query . by the way i 'm from philippines . regards , jm

my sponsor company applied on
my sponsor company applied on 9th april and i got the working visa on 18th april itself.i think it depends on the sponsor company and hr follow up with embassy .
visa issuance
within one day dear or next day visa issued if you have visa approval if not than need to apply for visa approval which will not take more than a week or ten days thanks

if the company has available
if the company has available visa for your nationality , teh2008 is right you can get it in a day or two . but there are factors why your visa has not been released yet , e.g. the pro is lazy , the pro is on vacation , no visa approval yet , the position is on hold , other internal factors from your employer or agent etc. better confirm again with your agent in the phils . to remind the employer : -RRB-

double check with your agent
double check with your agent again if the employer is really serious in employing you and request the reason why your visa has not been processed yet . if you can no longer wait then you might as well look for other opportunities . you have been waiting a long time already ... anyway , patience is a virtue : -RRB-

it 's really dependent on the urgency of the position . i was stayed in phil for more than 2 years waiting to finish the 2 yr ban . i had plenty of offers actually in ksa but i turned them down . last october 2011 , an employer in qatar called me , we discussed the offer and then i 'm there by mid dec. it was actually me who delayed it , could have been deployed by nov. . how ironic , i turned down plenty of offers in ksa but look where i am now . multiple business entry here but my rp is qatar . for your case , 5 mos maybe too long enough . try to get their -LRB- employer -RRB- position on the situation and if it 's doubtful , plenty of opportunity awaits elsewhere . goodluck ; -RRB-

family member visiting doha ... visa ?
hello , i was wondering if it 's easy for my mom , who is 82 years old , to come into doha to pay us a visit as a tourist ? other than paying the tourist entry visa at customs upon arrival , is there any other issue/s i should be aware of because of her age ? will she encounter any problems ? is the standard visit time for tourists 30 days ? any feedback welcome
i guess you are asking about
i guess you are asking about the visa on arrival as you are australian . its better to check with airport immigration regarding the age for visa on arrival . family visit visa is difficult for 65 + . tinker its not imposssible but very difficult , my mil is 77 . she came few months back .
i have no idea the process as
i have no idea the process as hubby took care of it ... anyways now she cant come as she is sick ...
it is difficult
i tried for monther last year she was 71 . . all my effort was vain ... ... anyway try your luck
i do n't want her to stay , she
i do n't want her to stay , she just wants to visit as a tourist to spend christmas with us . is it so difficult ?
if your mom is a widow , then
if your mom is a widow , then get an authenticated copy of the death certificate of your dad + the other docs required by the immigration . if not , both parents should travel as required . or go to the immigration and make clarifications .
you can make a family visa

real estate agent fake ?
hi , i have been offered a 3 bhk flat for qr 4500 but the rentals should be paid in one year advance which is about qr 54000 . i am not sure about this agent whether this is a fake or real ? please tell me if this is ok to go ahead with such an offer ? or is there any place where i can verify about this agent thanks in advance
re : real estate agent fake ?
bro , my piece of advice , advance rental payment of 1 year is not practical and very risky . i highly suggest that you look somewhere else . there are a lot of flats and villas right now being offered by the owner itself and not those filthy , good for nothing , boot-licking , single cell , blood-sucking and parasitic real estate agents . ahhh , that is much better . cheers ,
re : real estate agent fake ?
what you going to do if you are being redundant a month after you pay him ?
re : real estate agent fake ?
normally they asked post dated cheques but 1 year rent in advance , too risky so no way ...
re : real estate agent fake ?
i encountered these same individuals . when we requested copies of the contract between themselves and the owners , they mysteriously disappeared . everyone i questioned said this is a scam , which is becoming more common . a new 3 bedroom apartment for qr 4500 ... it was obviously too good to be true .
re : real estate agent fake ?
please dont risk that . my husband & i entered a similar deal , the landlord walked in on us saying he had cancelled his contarct with the agent and was asking us to retrieve our money and deal directly with him . we had trusted that the agent was working on teh landlors asignement & had even comfirmed this with contracts signed by the two . we are still struggling to get our money back from the agent & in the mean time the lanlord wants his pay so badly . dont even think abt it . pay monthly or simply give post dated cheques ... fore warned !

re : i would like buy slr cemara which one good brand
as a brand i will prefer nikon , sony is cheaper compared to other brands . if photography is not your profession , go for a beginner level camera . as you get used with slr camera , will be able to compare the defferent cameras and its features that are available in the market.on a later stage you can upgrade to a good one . sony alfa 230 is a cheap and best option .
re : i would like buy slr cemara which one good brand
i would suggest canon , its a user friendly othen than nikon . there is also some features in canon that you can not find in nikon .

what are my rights ?
i am ask to pay 14,500 so i can get my release papers , but when i already paid the said amount , still i 'm not getting any documents from them . what i have to do . anyone can give me advice or help me regarding this issue ?
yes . . ex-pats just like you
yes . . ex-pats just like you and me get treated like this . . horrible i say but i speak the truth .
i think they need more
i think they need more
not again ... i 'm sure you
not again ... i 'm sure you fall into trap ... if i not mistaken you have your visa from someone and then when you ask for release he will ask a sum of money from you . . i heard a lot of cases like this . but i feel sorry for you because you are one of the victim of bad business/money making activity by some locals ... it is definitely illegal therefore you have no any rights .
your right is
to visit ministry of labor and complain about your sponsor/company and about your case ... ! hope they will help you . . the second option is that hire a lawyer or complain about this to police ...
if you obtained your visa
if you obtained your visa illegally then you have no rights . if you want to retain your rights , do not buy a work visa .
@lincolnpirate
no i do n't have but they ask me to shoulder the rent a car , change of sponsorship and renewal of iqama etc. .
@just1s
i did n't buy my visa with them , i work as executive manager but suddenly comes a problem and they terminated me as sales executive and ask me to pay the said amount for car , transfer of sponsorship and iqama .
@omer . s55
i refuse to pay but they had already threatened me that they will bring all my documents to cid once i will not pay on that day . i also got statement of account on all things i paid to them but there is no signatory on it but there is a logo stamp on the paper . one thing more is he is a powerful person here in qatar so i get scared when he told me to bring one way ticket to hell .
@mr_qatar
if i am going to seek help from the ministry of labor , am i sure that i will be safe ? i 've seen a lot of people who complained but they were in big trouble , they are even sent to jail for just claiming for their rights .

re : could a single mom bring her daughter in qatar ?
if you have permament work visa here in qatar not any business or visit visa , and meet the salary requirment by labour dept min or above = qr .7500 then you are fully eligible to apply for your daughter visa as family visa . you need to get 1 . salary statement from you employee 2 . bank statement for 6 month of your salary account 3 . your company cr / computer card copy 4 . your qtel account number / electricy number of you house . 5 . your daughter brith certificate . -LRB- attest by your embassty and then by qatar ministry of forign affair -RRB- you first need to apply for approval at labour dept once approved then submit at immigration dept for visa . these are few that i can remember also do check with labour dept requirment and immigration dept for any more requirments .

im a filipina nurse with almost 17yr experience in medical-surgical nursing both in phil and saudi arabia , plans to visit qatar this month.would there be a chance for me to land a job?what are the requirements and qualifications needed , may it be in private or government hosp ?

where can i get legal lpg cylinder connection in qatar ?
dear all where can i get legal lpg cylinder connection in qatar ? what is cost for connection and regulator and refill charges what is overall procedure ? plz help me thank you kaustubh
re : where can i get legal lpg cylinder connection in qatar ?
there is no `` legal '' gas connection like in india those who have a gas stove , are `` eligible '' to buy a gas cylinder and start cooking
re : where can i get legal lpg cylinder connection in qatar ?
just go to nearest petrol pump and u will find a shop named sidra or at any supermarket nearby and ask for woqod gas cylinder . for the first time you will need to pay 360 for the cylinder and around 40 for the cylinder knob . gas stove , you may get it in all supermarkets . so after the cylinder gets over , just pay 15 qr for refilling the cylinder no need of any documents or any paper works , just cash will do .
re : where can i get legal lpg cylinder connection in qatar ?
thank you all for ur kind support

it usually takes 3-5 working
it usually takes 3-5 working days . they do not process visas but only certify that the paper you received from your sponsor here in qatar is legitimate . basically the embassy will only translate the entry visa that you will have to show to the visa personnel in naia prior to check in . once you arrive at the airport here in qatar , you have to show it to the immigration personnel on duty .
from the time u visit dhl
from the time u visit dhl just count 7 working days

dear adeel
i think it will be best for you to serve your wife with your own hand made food and at night you sit on your bed as your wife was sit on first night , asked her to come in room as you came and enjoy the night in new way . have a nice day wish u and all your family the best and may allah bless you with his blessings .
how old is your child ?
how old is your child ? you 've got 3 weeks to get your child into a better sleeping routine . it 's not easy , but it is possible . i would suggest skipping afternoon naps and wake your child up earlier than they 're used to . they 'll then start going to bed earlier in the evenings . it may not work for the first few days , but they 'll soon settle into a routine . in fact , you 'll be better off long term , this would make your life alot easier if you had every evening to yourselves . quality time as a couple is just as important as a family . hope this helps ! :--RRB- ***** if you have n't got anything nice to say , do n't say anything at all *****

no worries khanan & drmana , it took me a long time to get my 2 year old into a routine and i still have to go through it everytime we go back to the uk or come back here because of the time difference . i would also suggest giving a bath before bed , it relaxes them and they understand after a while that after a bath i must go to bed . i 'm not an expert , far from it , but this works for me . it 's different for all children , you have to do what works best for you :--RRB- ***** if you have n't got anything nice to say , do n't say anything at all *****

best celebration after 5 years is at home , put children in bed early , do your wife a nice dinner , and spend the whole night talking and remembering all beautiful moments of your life together , you 'll score a big time at the end ;-RRB- p.s. do n't forget some lavender candles in bed room :-RRB- yalla !

skype is a telephone and videophone service program ... either way you can download it to your mobile by visiting -LRB- www.skype.com -RRB-
re : skype mobile
even if you get hold of skype mobile , it wont work as it is intended to as it is launched by 3mobile for their markets and here qtel is going to charge you for the data transfer it makes while making skype calls . so technically it works as any other 3.5 g mobile with skype installed in it , if you are badly looking for that skype dedicated button , take any nokia latest e series and assign one of the one touch buttons on it to skype .

is there a cure for rheumatoid arthritis ?
my mother suffers from rheumatoid arthritis and have undergone many treatments including ayurvedic , acupuncture and homeopathy but none gave permanent resoluations . she 's 54 . can someone share , suggest or recommend any kind of treatment ?
re : is there a cure for rheumatoid arthritis ?
there 's no permanent treatment for this , only pallative treatment to ease the pain . my 72 years old mother is taking alluperinol & pain killers such as mobic or simply muscadol . but you should consult your doctor because your mother may be taking other medicines and may have drug reactions .
re : is there a cure for rheumatoid arthritis ?
as far as i know therez no permanent cure , ayurvedic and other treatments can reduce the intensity . my friend just 30 years old is suffering from ra .
re : is there a cure for rheumatoid arthritis ?
yes , it is . did you tried acupressure ? if you need more details , call me 5841088 ck
re : is there a cure for rheumatoid arthritis ?
no cure , but there are ways to minimize the symptions and lesson the damage to the joints . i see a r.a. doctor at hamad regularly . i am so much better after having started humira injections every two weeks . i also regularly take methotrexate -LRB- once a week -RRB- . i had been on prednisone but have weaned myself off of that , thank goodness , but at the time , i really needed it . it was the first thing that ever helped me . i call it a miracle drug . without these medications i was a basketcase . now i am fine . i have regular blood tests every 4 to 8 weeks to keep an eye on any problems arising from the medications . my ra was diagnosed in nov 2008 . good luck !!
re : is there a cure for rheumatoid arthritis ?
<p> there is no known cure for rheumatoid arthritis , but many different types of treatment can alleviate symptoms and modify the disease process . alleviating the current symptoms , and preventing the future destruction of the joints with the resulting handicap if the disease is left unchecked . ra should generally be treated with at least one specific anti-rheumatic medication . <a href="http://www.fitnesshealthzone.com/yoga/top-10-yoga-poses-for-relieving-headaches-and-shoulder-pain/"> yoga poses </a> </p>

about mozaic tv +
i got mozaic tv + connection from dec 1st . and i got first bill now that is amounted 450 riyal . which coming 250 riyal for rent and 200 riyal for initiation charge . but qtel have an offer now all installation charge is free upto dec 31st . then what is initiation charge ?
re : about mozaic tv +
check the due amount to pay and if it is above 250 call 111 and ask .
re : about mozaic tv +
dear friend ... happen same to me almost 7 month ... during register and installion they -LRB- qtel -RRB- said that 250 permonth ... but i have to pay 285 permonth when received the bill ... keep asking qtel ... same answer ... always said next month u paid 250 ... already 6 month ... fed up no asking anymore . . just paid 285 permonth .
re : about mozaic tv +
the promotion probably started a day after your installation , or ended a day before . even if you prove it , and convince them , qtel does n't do refunds , they 'll keep it in your account for that service .
re : about mozaic tv +
sorry guy for posting again . i am using mozaic tv + which was taken during the promotional period . i am paying only qr . 250 / - per month . i dont think there are hidden charges for qtel services . it will be better you call qtel and inform them about it . they will ask you to pay the bill completely and will give you a credit for the difference which will be adjusted in your next bill .
re : about mozaic tv +
i called q-tel they told to me if you do n't have land line then will pay landline installation charge.but in the qtel site clearly specified all installation is free . i cut from site that words below . today qtel unveil mozaic tv + service as part of its summer promotion series with substantial discounts for families to entertain themselves while at home . this promotion carries up to qr1290 in savings which includes free installation and free additional channels for two consecutive months . what you think about this ?
re : about mozaic tv +
i think its mistake from qtel . talk with qtel representive . i also got mozaic and istalation for me is free . so they will definetlly adjust in next bill
re : about mozaic tv +
and also in advertisement they specified for more information call 111 . then i called this number and asked about the landline installation they told to me all installation charge is free including landline also . yesturday my friend called this number , again they told like that . then why they charged landline installation charge ? . if they charged installation charge then should get all fecilities like : international and mobile calls also . but i got only landline to landline only . at the application time they didi n't ask for which fecilities you needed ? . thatmeans this telephone include this package .125 digital tv channels basic channels + additional channels -LRB- 2 month free -RRB- + 512 mb speed network connection + home telephone -LRB- landline to landline -RRB- .

thank you so much magicdragon . does that mean they have to give the eosb -LRB- min . 3 weeks -RRB- even if it 's not mentioned in our actual contract ? is it law that a small non-govenment company has to give a letter of no objection if they end your contract 5 month before the contract finishes due to their not having work ? also : a -RRB- if i/we cancel our rp and leave the country without a no objection letter , is there any restrictions on me -LRB- or our family -RRB- being allowed back into the country on a visitor 's visa , obtained from the airport ? b -RRB- if work cancels my rp whilst we are out of the country , and we do n't have a no objection letter , can we enter the country again on a visitors visa obtained at the airport ? is there any site to go to and check your status of rp ? how would you be notified if your rp had been cancelled ?
yes , in order for your
yes , in order for your company to have opted out of the end-of-service gratuity it would have to be in your contract . otherwise , it 's there . secondly , i do n't know of any rules that say companies must give an noc in such-and-such circumstances . it seems to be totally up to their discretion . finally , if you have been on a family visa you do n't need an noc to re-enter after your rp is canceled/expired . only the worker needs an noc and he/she always needs an noc within the two year time frame . mandi

re : hi , can anybody advise me where i find a kia dealer ...
hhhhhhhhhhhmmmmmmmmmm . i think brit is the right person to ask when it comes to kia . lol
re : hi , can anybody advise me where i find a kia dealer ...
yeah , i know where 's the ramada junction and know where 's the fly over dring so i guess kia is somewhere close to nissan-renault dealer , right ?
re : hi , can anybody advise me where i find a kia dealer ...
on the salwa road , where nissan is on your left side , go straight pass the flyover , 1st roundabout take the 2nd exit -LRB- 12 o'clock -RRB- , you will pass the mercedes showroom , futher down you will see a mitsubishi showroom , 2nd roundabout , take 12 o'clock again , and maintain on your right side , take either the 2nd or 3rd junction to the right , and the kia showroom is nearing the end of that small road .
re : hi , can anybody advise me where i find a kia dealer ...
go over the flyover , past the decoration r/a , continue straight after about 2 r/a you will find kia motors on your right , if you miss it , not to worry , there is another kia showroom after the next r/a . . again on the right
re : hi , can anybody advise me where i find a kia dealer ...
check the google map , please . if going down al muntazah from city centre , this kia dealer is 50 meters before al aziziyah round about , on your right . and this al aziziya roundabout is the junction of sports city street and al muntazah .

what is the best and easy way to send lcd tv 32inch to india ?
hi . . i would like to know what is the best and cheapest -LRB- of course , safe too -RRB- to send one 32inch lcd tv to india ? is it possible to send lcd tv 's along with people who are going to india as luggage ?? or is it too big for that ? please if you know anyone who is forwarding this kind of things . . please let me know . . thanks
re : what is the best and easy way to send lcd tv 32inch ...
32 '' sony bravia , weighs around 22kg only with original packing . i 'm not sure the original packing will be safe enough to put as a luggage . you may use another packing over the original packing and fill with clothes to absorb any shockes during rough handling . the weight and size is ok as luggage in passenger a flight . but not suitable for hand baggage as it 's size is more than permittable for hand baggage .
re : what is the best and easy way to send lcd tv 32inch ...
the brand which i have is that samsung . i got it for special price -LRB- 1399 -RRB- along with wall bracket . so i felt it would be cheaper to send as its on a special price :-RRB- . .
re : what is the best and easy way to send lcd tv 32inch ...
why r u taking it to india dude , u get the same piece for a bit more and are assured of a 3 year warranty ... and also a lot more accessories . i was in india in jan and was surprised that toys and electronics are priced almost the same ... hope this helps
re : what is the best and easy way to send lcd tv 32inch ...
there are so many door to door service personnel in doha , check with them , i 'm sure they will send the same safely . if u find any , do n't forget to post the details here so that others can also think of your innovative idea ...
re : what is the best and easy way to send lcd tv 32inch ...
i can send contact -LRB- yadu -RRB- qnt cargo 3249842 email yadu.qntcargo@dtco-qatar.com
re : what is the best and easy way to send lcd tv 32inch ...
i think it will be much better to buy it in india as the price difference is reasonable and you will get service as well as warranty . if you are taking it from here to india either you have to take it with you or you have to send it by air or sea cargo . it is bulky and heavy to handle it at the airports . i think a 32 '' lcd tv will weigh more than 20kg . if you are sending it by cargo they will pack it for you and i think it will cost you approximately qr . 800 / - -LRB- pls check with any cargo -RRB- including freight -LRB- air -RRB- and customs duty and if you spend one third of that with the price you are paying here for the tv you will get it delivered in your house with service and warranty in india .
re : what is the best and easy way to send lcd tv 32inch ...
the best is by dhl good luck
re : what is the best and easy way to send lcd tv 32inch ...
buy sony bravia . it 's the best brand in the market . prices of lcd tv now are very cheap . gud luck !
re : what is the best and easy way to send lcd tv 32inch ...
yes you can do that . you can have it in your luggage when you go home . nothing will happen and it will not damage the tv . just make sure to have it tightly packed . do n't send it by air or sea freight because they will charge you too much . gud luck !
re : what is the best and easy way to send lcd tv 32inch ...
samsung is way better than sony bravia . if you are getting it free as a gift fine , otherwise why would you buy and ship it from qatar ???? . its cheaper in india .
re : what is the best and easy way to send lcd tv 32inch ...
i think his question is not to compare the lcd tv brands .

sub means `` to pour '' and subb
sub means `` to pour '' and subb lak alkahwa = to pour coffee for you so any drink or liquid can use that word with or even casting concrete subb kharasana hope that helps

where can i buy proper alcohol free wine ???
hi i would like to find somewhere that sells alcohol free wine - i do n't mean sweet grape juice in a wine bottle , but proper dry -LRB- ie not sweet -RRB- fermented wine that has been de-alcoholized -RRB- . dry non alcoholic beer is available here , but i ca n't find non alcoholic wine - i would be really pleased if someone could help me out with some suggestions . many thanks !
re : where can i buy proper alcohol free wine ???
have you been drinking too much wine ... does such wine exist and if so what is the point ? that is like having a car without any wheels and an invitation to the playboy mansion with only 10 mintues to get there ...
re : where can i buy proper alcohol free wine ???
wine is a wine ...
re : where can i buy proper alcohol free wine ???
its called sparkling grapejuice my friend ... lol
re : where can i buy proper alcohol free wine ???
yes such a thing exists , just like for beer - they make it as usual then use one of several processes to remove the alcohol without removing the distinctive taste . lol i would liken it to a car with no emissions rather than no wheels !!! some people , for medical , religious , driving or other reasons -LRB- my mum for example gets drunk after a thimble-full of wine -RRB- like to enjoy the taste of wine without the alcoholic effects . here is a website selling it , but i want it here in qatar !!! i would have thought that with all the rich arabs around , there would be a demand for it ... .
re : where can i buy proper alcohol free wine ???
lol most of the non alcoholic beers do indeed taste appalling , more like horlicks , however as a previously committed beer drinker and member of the campaign for real ale , i can say that some alcohol free beers are acceptable . the key to it is de-alcoholising a fully fermented malt , rather than halting the fermentation early , which leaves it sweet-tasting . in doha the only one that is ok is holsten , but others exist outside doha . still waiting for someone to point me in the right direction !

how is ford explorer ?
guys ! just want to know how 's the handling and steering of the ford explorer ? i do n't want to base my judgment on the reviews so if you have driven this one , kindly advise . thanks .
re : how is ford explorer ?
very bad services and spareparts . . i guess . others are ok and i like its 4x4 what about the prices ?
re : how is ford explorer ?
hi , i have an older 2003 model . it drives very well . no problems . i bought it because it 's more compact than the large toyotas . drives more like a car . steering & handling good . power is good . 4.0 ltr v6 is well tried & tested . this is the biggest selling suv in america for many years . no problems at all with service & none for spare parts if you visit the ford service centre . i was just out there on saturday to get a new cap for the brake master cylinder reservoir which some-how went missing . they looked it up on the computer - cost was qr10 . plus a new rubber bumper for the rear door latch was also missing - again no problem at all . cost qr5 .
re : how is ford explorer ?
you are all a great help guys ... now i 'm thinking again between ford and gmc ... thanks for advise and all the best !
re : how is ford explorer ?
ford service is below acceptable . gmc are way better in service . but if i were you i would hold on to that thought . who knows what will happen ? these companies are on the brink of bankruptcy . i myself have an american car , so nothing against the cars , it 's the timing .
re : how is ford explorer ?
good car , i run and own a 2006 model , no problems good for doha road conditions . 4.0 l but economical to run . only down side is no cd , 2007 onwards have cd . struggled with a/c in the summer when sat in traffic once on the move it was fine .
re : how is ford explorer ?
thanks bro but how 's the steering ? the maneuver and wheel bent ? does the power steering is smooth to handle ?
re : how is ford explorer ?
power steering is smooth and everything is okay . the only thing that i hate is service centre for ford is suckss . too slow and took 2 days for changing engine oil ? if u have any other trouble . . it will takes at least 1 week before u can get back your car . . suckss

yeah
yeah last wednesday morning , i got the shock , when is aw hoards of people working in doha walking to oryx rotana and in notime rotana was looking like a railway station in india . then realised that they all had come for interviews for ndia jobs where recruitment was going on , on the 1st floor of oryx rotana . later they ended up collecting all candidates cv , s and told them - they will call them later , which provided some space in the hotel for the people staying there . i guess this question is related to the above . but wonder how people working here can switch jobs locally without noc or all these people on visit visa hunting for jobs ?

i thought i saw in the job ad that you had to be on an rp for the interview , and not a visit visa . or am i wrong ? but if so , how will these people get nocs to work at the airport ? would n't it be much easier for ndia just to hire people directly from overseas than locally in qatar ?

there are several things you can do . 1 . sprinkel your bed with pif paf powder and after it having been on your matress , hovver it up . 2 . do the above , then let it sit out in the sun for several hours . 3 . buy a new matress . i also recommend you treat your house and get the pest control in . you can google to find more info on this suject matter ! good luck
re : bed bugs ??
if they are in your house you are screwed . i have had these before and wouldnt wish them on my worst enemy . google bed bugs for the tips . you need to take this seriously and buy a new mattress .

sponsoring my family
dear friends i am working in a private sector company and i want to sponsor my family therefore how many months bank statements should i provide ? this question may be raised several times in the past i am apologizing for your valuable time
re : sponsoring my family
minimum 3 months bank statement required as per the requirements , but sometime less than that will also do , if u are salary is above 7000qr getting family visa is not a matter of worry .
re : sponsoring my family
hope this helps :-RRB- you will be given a form to complete with a list of the relevant documents : approval letter from work , bank statement of salary for the last six months -LRB- for non-government employees -RRB- , marriage certificates , children 's birth certificates and education certificates -LRB- although you do n't always need these in practice -RRB- . the last three should be certified , but in practice you probably do n't need to . photocopies are acceptable . you also need passport photos of yourself , your spouse and your children . read more : http://www.qatarvisitor.com/index.php?cid=413&pid=978&cname=travel&pname=visas#family#ixzz13pza3kza

help !! how to stop severe hair fall
i know this topic has been beaten to a pulp , so to speak . but my problem is not male pattern baldness -LRB- alopecia -RRB- which is genetic and ca n't be stopped , for now . i 'm starting to lose much more than the normal amount of hair that falls every day . does anyone out there know or is using some home remedy to stop hair fall ? please share . i 'm worried that if it continues , it will result to something like this :
change your shampoo .
or better yet , stop using for now . if not , maybe the food you eat ...
azi , thanks . do you have any
azi , thanks . do you have any idea about foods that can cause -LRB- or may trigger -RRB- hair loss ? i have also thought about that because since i came here my diet has changed from what i used to eat back home .
go back to micronesia for a
go back to micronesia for a month or so and see if it makes any difference . if it does , never come back . if it does n't , stay another month and get it treated by a good dermatologist .
there you go ... must be the food
too much of everything is bad . egg , chicken , nuts ... anything oily , perhaps ?
if u are eating out regularly
if u are eating out regularly -LRB- i do -RRB- or otherwise and think that not much proteins are going into your system get some protein supplements . atleast it stopped hair fall for me -LRB- dont ask me how and why as i have no medical support to prove it ... some guy from nutrilite spoke to me and suggested , i followed and it worked -RRB- . but again you may not take my word and decide for yourself .

loan repayment
have a loan from ahli bank for 150000qrs for 4 years . planning to clear it in one settlement . what are the procedures and will they charge me anything for this action ? now the interest rate is 6 % flat .
i think -LRB- when i took a loan
i think -LRB- when i took a loan from hsbc -RRB- you will have to pay a high interest during the first year if you want to clear your loan . after the first year you pay only 1 % on the balance amount and get a clearance letter . but it is always better to check with the customer service at the bank as sometimes rules change and each bank may have their own policy . however , qatar central bank set the rules , so be sure the bank is not ripping you off .
yes they do apply a penalty .
yes they do apply a penalty . and i think it 's 1 or 2 % of the remaining amount without interest . so basically if you had to pay 100 qr -LRB- no interest included -RRB- you will end up paying 101 qr . they apply this penalty because they are not entitled to charge you the interest anymore . banks ... ca n't live with them , ca n't live without them ...
they apply the penalty
they apply the penalty because by repaying your loan early they are not making any more money off the loan -LRB- in the form of interest -RRB- .
is it same for car loan also ?
is it same for car loan also ?
1 % charges . . i did the same
1 % charges . . i did the same but ahli s *** ing us
it 's the same for all loans
it 's the same for all loans
the procedure is simple but
the procedure is simple but it takes some time . you will go to ahli and tell them that you want to repay your loan in full . they will make the paperwork and contact you . normally there are no taxes besides the leftover amount you have to pay back . but this is qatar ... nothing is normal when it comes to banking . so they might charge you ... why do n't you just give them a call and ask .

friend numbers in qatar have changed
you need to repeat the first digit to call your friend for example : > a education centre in qatar gave you number 2 years ago : 4212590 . you could dial +974-4212590 . > but now you have to dial +974 -4 -4212590 . -LRB- be careful to understand what i said , it is repeating the digit and not adding any 4 -RRB- . this answer is given because she didnt tell when she received the call .

good question coz one of my frnd 's is looking for the same thing as well .
re : where can i buy the proactiv skin care system in doha ?
simsigat , where in doha , exactly ?
re : where can i buy the proactiv skin care system in doha ?
i am not sure if you will find proactive in qatar . skincare is something which the consumers have a sort of loyalty . a consumer who is using clinque , clarins or lancome products are not going to change to a new brand even if it is having very good products or marketing strategy . it will be difficult for a brand like proactive to survive in a niche skincare market like qatar . it will be better if you can buy it on line or arrange with someone to buy it from us .
re : where can i buy the proactiv skin care system in doha ?
why hunting for proactive ? if you are having any facial issue , just try some very simple but great results home remedies.its easy and doest cost a lot . good luck

that game was an absolute
that game was an absolute disgrace - players intent on getting each other sent off , more activity on the bench than on the field , moroninho acting like the petulant child that he is - spanish football at its cheating , lying , snide worst - `` great game '' - common brit , id rather watch accrington stans v port vale !! if thats the best thats on offer , better neither of them turn up at wembley for the final and united just take the trophy by default . the contrast between tueasday nights game and wednesday nights game was stark . its little wonder to me that the football naive fans of the middle east are taken in by spanish football .

do landlords refund advance and post dated cheques if leaving country ?
hi my relative may be leaving qatar shortly and wanted to know if the landlord will refund advance and post dated cheques ? is there any law pertaining to this ? i had heard that they do return the money if one is leaving the country but wanted to know is thst just based on goodwill of the landlord or is there some law ?
re : do landlords refund advance and post dated cheques if ...
renting law in qatar states that if your rp is cancelled the landlord must refund all paid rents and return the cheques . the normal notice period is 1 month but you are not responsible if you are fired without notice and your rp cancelled . these people are crooks , dont let them take you for a greedy ride .
re : do landlords refund advance and post dated cheques if ...
deposit amount ... yes but , about the taken back the checkes b4 the end of the leasing contract ... depends on the contract between the two parties . . but usually this issue can be solved by posting an early termination letter to the lanlord befor 2-3 month from the date of leaving . watching yoo
re : do landlords refund advance and post dated cheques if ...
as i know legally you shall pay for entire contract period and the land lord will not be in need to return your cheque . but here the land lords will be very happy when they understand you are leaving since they can give to some one for higher rent . in addition they will get rent amount for one or two months from the date of vacating . -LRB- free rent -RRB- . if you are lucky u will get back your cheques without any deduction . but remember u r in qatar .
cruel conditions for visa ??
hello everybody , i would like to know why they do n't allow for people over 63 y.o. to visit qatar . does it make any sense ?
re : cruel conditions for visa ??
them roof , them rules ! you compmain about it , get deported !
re : cruel conditions for visa ??
because some nationalities are more likely to bring over elderly relatives to take advantage of the healthcare that is provided here . and those same nationalities are less likely to come and visit here and spend lots of money on accomodation , shopping etc. unless you are contributing to the economy , either as a wage earner or a high spending tourist , you are n't really welcome here . and if your parents are that age , you should be visiting them , not vice versa .
re : cruel conditions for visa ??
seniors both my parents as well as my inlaws have come here to visit our family . all 4 people were well in their 70 's , so do n't think that is the rule .
re : cruel conditions for visa ??
ah deedee it depends on your nationality !!!
re : cruel conditions for visa ??
the medical liability is an issue for them . however , you can get them to visit you . all you need is a special permission from the captain at the immigration .
re : cruel conditions for visa ??
yes , you need to talk to the authorised person in the visa office to get a special permission . i did for my mother and without any hassel he signed my documents .
re : cruel conditions for visa ??
i read a post from deedee that all his parents and the in-laws above 70 years were able to visit qatar . deedee it depends on your nationality and i know yours . it will not be the same for someone from asia . they should approach the concerend officers to special approvl for it .
re : cruel conditions for visa ??
ah !! come on people , the place where i am from is where a lot gulf citizens go seeking a healthcare !!! moreover , i wo n't ask parents to come here if they are on a wheelchair ???? both are still healthy and very well , was john mccain 72 ? and a lot of political characters over 65 ? are they entitled to have a visa to qatar ?? anyway , everyone comes here to qatar hi is very likely to spend ; he will not come if he does n't spend , and to `` rami-leb '' ... yeh you bet , how could i forget such a solution ? i have to visit them , thx for advice and i appreciate your idea >> > finally thx for every one has answered my q.
re : cruel conditions for visa ??
well i do n't believe it has anything to do with the health care issue . first of all hmc only treats for free those who have a health card and therefore they must be residents not visitors , if you do n't have a health card you 'll pay for whatever treatment you get except for emergencies . second thought let us say it was really all about health care issues and not providing the emergency cases for free to sick elders who are none residents then simply the sponsor could be asked to sign a form where he will be responsible for any unsettled treatment payments for a visiting relative , or perhaps those over a certain age could pay in the airport a health insurance fee , instead of simply not allowing the elderly - who should be treated with more respect honestly - to enter . after all what 's the median age of the parents of working residents here ? 40 ? i do n't think so . but as some people say it 's their roof , their country , let them do with it what ever they want .

re : what are the requirements to take a car to saudi on ...
travelling by car is quite easy , affordable and enjoyable . but a bit expensive comparing to bus travel . but this is quite easy and for the roads these are excellent . you will have to recheck your vehicle before travelling . especially the tyres . and even if you do n't know the routes , just no problem -LRB- either take gps or you will have to travel on the highway straight . and you can ask anyone on the gas station in the way , they will guide you . travelling on your own car will be a great experience . have a nice trip thanks

kabayan , you better call and ask the catholic church here in qatar ... they have their own website . . google it ... they can give you the right answer to your question regarding fees for church wedding ...
um , if its roman catholic it
um , if its roman catholic it should be free ! you can just speak with the priest and make a subtle offering to them which is up to you . they may ask you not to bring in flowers etc and it is really just up to you . if you have it outside of italy then you will have to have all your documents etc sent off to the vatican for registration and they will want to know details about your local diocese . congratulations and best of luck . if i can offer any advice to folks getting married is do n't spend large on flowers and decorations -LRB- apart from for the brides bouquet , it will be in lots of photos -RRB- and do spend up large on the photographer as you will want quality .

grass fed
well , i follow paleo diet ; therefore , i am after grass fed meat which is likely impossible in qatar . i used to in australia where mostly cattle are grass fed . i know , they ca n't export their grass fed animals because they do n't look healthy physically but still aussie meat will be somewhat grass-fed .
are we in funnies

aussie lamb ? i hear they

aussie meat at mira
vanmost , i found australian lamb at mira that is very fatty but so nice in taste . it is about 15 qr per kilo . when i read what you said about grass fed animals and how importers do not prefer it , i thought maybe that lamb is grass fed , that 's why it 's less in price and has more fat . please reply because i was looking for grass fed meat since i arrived in qatar last year but no way the stores will tell you what kind of food animals have . if that mira lamb is grass fed it will be the greatest news for me , since it tastes nice and much less in price than other meats .
check with elsenin at nasser
check with elsenin at nasser street opposite to gardenia and gulf colour .
van , it 's a joke
peace !
watch your words
i guess , you have to watch your words . pakistani grass fed animals are seen in villages only or in northern areas , they are not exported to anywhere . most of the to-be-exported animals are fed corn or grains .
vanmost , now , i do not know
vanmost , now , i do not know this for sure , but i have been told that meat from nz is all grass fed .
and good luck doing paleo
and good luck doing paleo here ... i would not even try to accomplish that here . it 's hard enough to find stuff for a normal diet .
nomerci
@nomerci ... as i told earlier , grass fed animals do n't look healthy and they got yellow fat as well . therefore , mostly importers do n't want that meat because consumers are not aware of facts . so , every exporter has to give some grains and corn to animals even aussie and new zealanders also do . but still their meat is rich in omega 3 ... i know , it will be hard to follow paleo or maybe i have to converted it into low carb ... but i will try my best : -RRB-

not possible ...
you may have the noc on hands from your current sponsor , but the immigration will not allows you to change your sponsor , when you did not completed a 1 full year work visa with the same sponsor . and working with another company not your sponsor is certainly illegal .

that is possible . but your visa should be cancelled by your sponsor and you need `` noc to return within the 2yrs banned period '' . note : noc to transfer sponsor is different from noc to return w/in 2yrs banned period .

did you experience this situation coz i discuss the issue of some hr-pro the give me different answer the other one give me 95 % assurance that i will not be banned but other pro give 100 % assurance that it will be ok to transfer to other sponsor . with this two different assurance one thing the are in common that i will exit to my country of origin and back here in doha for new visa .
you will be banned for 2yrs
you will be banned for 2yrs once your rp is cancelled , which is why you need to reassure that your current employer will grant you an noc to return . please note that your rp must be cancelled prior to exit , otherwise your new employer wont be able to apply a new visa for you . once you exit the state , and with an noc on hands , things will be fine with you , in god 's will ! but changing sponsor within a year working of the same sponsor with a work visa/permanent visa stamped on your passport and without exit will not be possible for you as per immigration rules . you can double check with your company 's pro , though .
fado ... very difficult
before or after a year , its difficult to grant you one , specially if your employer is qatari . be careful please . salam
i doubt if
you will be able to change sponsorship within the first year . that was the answer i was given when i tried in 2004 even though the company were prepared to give me an noc and i had another job and sponsor lined up .
... apple , dweller ...
yes , it is possible . i have seen a guy , who changed after 8 months of his joining . in that case , 1 . the first sponsor did give an noc 2 . the second sponsr was a strong , reputed one in the abvoe criteria , it can be possible .
guys , no need to doubt it ! i
guys , no need to doubt it ! i have changed the sponsorship within 1 year . i personally . as the matter of fact , my rp was just `` 5 month old '' at that time ... apple , noc is noc . it means the previous sponsor does not mind you to work for another company . you can either transfer your sponsorship right away , even within 1 year , sometimes even without leaving qatar , or you can leave qatar , to find another job and come back any time without waiting till 2 year ban is over . all the guy needs is noc letter . and hey , it 's better not to belong to very few nationalities when as someone said , he might be asked to leave qatar within 48 hours . but this is a different story and has nothing to do with noc , or duration of work with the previous sponsor . some people try to just renew their rps and asked to leave country . so get a noc and good luck with your new job ! <i> <b> ********************* you become responsible forever for what you have tamed . antoine de saint-exupry </b> </i> <img src="http://cdnll.img1.imagechef.com/w/080610/anmd46ebbf9c8c024ef.gif">
qs , you are always special
qs , you are always special dahlin , no doubt on that ;-RRB- -RRB- now i have this thoughts in mind , does the law based on some nationalities too ? because normally , like dweller said , you can not made it possible w/in a yr . ? at least that 's what we 've been told .
apple , someone asked me
apple , someone asked me once : what are the immigration/labour rules in qatar ? my answer was simple : rule # 1 -LRB- and often the only 1 -RRB- : `` there are no rules '' . what is perfectly working for one , irrespective of ones nationality , gender , age , religion , political preferences , etc. , might not working for another , irrespective of anothers nationality , gender ... see above :-RRB- ... moreover , whatever worked for one person once , might not work for the same person next time -LRB- with the same name , same passport number , same nationality , same gender . . see above . . -RRB- so , when the questing starts from `` is it possible ... ? '' , the answer is `` everything is possible '' . and that was my point , dear :-RRB- how are you anyway ? long time <i> <b> ********************* you become responsible forever for what you have tamed . antoine de saint-exupry </b> </i> <img src="http://cdnll.img1.imagechef.com/w/080610/anmd46ebbf9c8c024ef.gif">
qs : -RRB-

@blosted , i wo n't call it uncivilized manner of responses

@azilana sometimes the `` discussing '' option is not available like in many countries such as indonesia and iraq during saddam 's time . and some cases including qatar , but qatar and uae are less strict than say saudi arabia .

their culture and beliefs ... and sticks to the topic , it 'll be a healthy discussion . it was possible before ... why ca n't it be now ? i guess the type of people who posted then and the ones currently active has different mindset . : -RRB-
what defines civilized ?
seriously this question is like , let 's say you blosted i know your an athiest , and let 's say me i am religious , now here is a question we talk about a topic let 's say we talk about the big bang theory -LRB- not the tv show xd -RRB- , my beliefs and your beliefs are going to crash , in which it would become uncivilized , so i think thier should be like a safe word or something were to end the discussion .
/ - a-t - / gmz21 i 'm sorry but
@gmz21 i 'm sorry but you ca n't mess around with the big bang theory , since it 's only one agreed upon theory . if you try to change some technical facts of the theory , everyone is happy as long as you got the evidence . but theories do not depend about how you see them , they are what they are , not what we perceive them to be . unfortunately for the conspiracy theorists lol .

@blosted
no one is argueing with with the saddam issue we all know how bad he was , but you have to remind yourself what was the reason for the iraq war , george w. bush stated `` weapons of mass destruction '' , but back then most iraqis -LRB- again the people who lived in iraq not american soldiers or media -RRB- , state it was safer to walk in the street at night , and now it 's unsafe to walk in the morning . now yes saddam did horrible things i should know i lived in kuwait , i was born in kuwait and i was barely 3 years when the gulf war invasion happened . so my parents tell me stories , and their families . but if you think it 's safer in iraq now , your information is being biased that america did the best , thing they could .
/ - a-t - / gmz21 no one is
@gmz21 no one is arguing that the americans did a blow job , they always do , but at least now women got rights and girls and boys can finally get schooling . i mean it 's a start for a free society , but whatever it is i do n't think being threatened 24/7 by a fascist leader makes it any safer . maybe it was safer to walk at night because there were n't much `` freedom fighters '' or much extremists active back then for the sole reason that they were afraid or collaborating with saddam . but getting rid of them will take effort and time and it should not stop now . @deadman123 common interest is not a problem , there is no specific interests but what we want is a enjoyable group which is very practical .

@xena i 'm also sick of people going around denying facts and trying to stuff in their own information with fallacious arguments that are in no way evidence based . like people who think that afghanistan or iraq would have been better without western intervention or like holocaust deniers , it just seems these conspiracy theories are the result of their -LRB- unfortunately -RRB- religious beliefs . i mean why do n't these people deny the armenian genocide ? because it simply does n't have anything to do with jews or such . and that 's the group of people i am just sick tired to debate with .
i just ca n't the `` culture and
i just ca n't get the `` culture and beliefs '' argument through ! i mean we were talking about how shoving things down one 's throat is not a fancy thing to do , and when it 's done you 'd just call it culture or belief ? nonetheless that is certainly not a civilized thing to do .

@stealth saying so just shows your ignorance about the fascist reign of saddam hussein which forces you to see your family while getting executed by shooting squad and still would force you to smile and clap with a big smile .
@blosted
you know that a theory could be proven wrong by the tiniest thing why their called theory not facts , and that is false the most agreed theory is the pythagorean theory which is still a theory . i never stated i do n't find the big bang theory incorrect you just began attacking man , i was using it as an example . like if you want a civilized discussion you should try to understand both sides of the argument . example would be the iraq war you know what iraqis say now , with saddam their was safety but no freedom , but without saddam we have freedom but no safety . this does n't mean that you 're wrong or that stealth is wrong , you are both right . you believe now they can vote and not be scared of their government officials . while stealth believes now there is a very high rate of crime , which was n't around the time during saddam 's time .
maybe the iraqis had so much
maybe the iraqis had so much pride in thmeselves that some western power was the one who got rid of saddam rather than themselves . by them i mean the same people fighting the americans now who happened to be the same people cowering in their houses when saddams cronies used to pass by . yep . that must be it . pride . same with the afghans i think .

opening a bank acct
i have recently come to qatar on a work visa . my sponsors will not start a salary acct for me in any bank . i need to open an acct after which they will deposit my salary to the same . can anyone tell me the procedure to start an acct and the necessary documents i may need to start an acct ??? appreciate straight answers ...
re : opening a bank acct
your sponsor will need to write a letter to the bank , listing the usuals , plus the amount of your salary . then you take this letter to the bank , along with your residence permit , fill out the forms and you should get an account .
re : opening a bank acct
you need a letter from your sponsor - they should be telling you this !!!
re : opening a bank acct
a few years ago i was on visit visa , and i was able to open up a savings account . the bank just asked for my passport and took copy of my visa stamp page . i got an atm card but no cheque book . this was with doha bank . try smaller less busy branches and speak to a customer services person and discuss your options with them . however , this was a few years back , . . they might have changed those rules . try a few banks and ask if they can open you a savings account . good luck !

the yellow sticker is a parking fine worth qr500 and 3 points on your licence .
re : yellow sticker on my car
yellow sticker is a parking ticket . there are different fines depending on what the officer thinks your offense is the fine ranges from 300 to 6,000 ! yes , that 's not a typo . i took mine to the city center mall , bottom floor ministry of interior kiosk . gave it to the nice man , along with my license and registration . he asked for my bank card , swiped it and i paid 300qr fine and got 3 points . all because i parked in a dirt lot . shame on me !

congratulations on accomplishing a qrs . 500 / - traffic violation ... pay the due before your next istamara ... and wait for 1 week for it to appear on the website ...
re : yellow sticker on my car
sound the winning bell ! you have just won a parking violation from the police ! it 'll cost you between 300 / - qr and 500 / - qr ... depends on what kind of parking violation committed . take care of it immediately and be careful not to get anymore . it 'll knock 3 points off of your driver 's license and you only have 12 points on there . so now you have 9 points . if you hit 12 points , they 'll revoke your license anywhere from 6 months to a year . sucks , i know .

what kind of router are you using btw ? can you check the ip range that your router dhcp server -LSB- if it 's working -RSB- is assigning to the clients ? if you know the range , just try assigning your wireless connection on the pda a static ip address . the dhcp on the router might be disabled ... do not dwell in the past , do not dream of the future , concentrate the mind on the present moment . <strong> -LRB- gautama buddha -RRB- </strong>

that is the thing ... it 's either you will enable dhcp or assign the following ip to your pda assuming the the subnet on your linksys is the default : <a href="http://img233.imageshack.us/my.php?image=iptg4.jpg" target="_blank"> <img src="http://img233.imageshack.us/img233/8915/iptg4.th.jpg" border="0" alt="free image hosting at www.imageshack.us" /> </a> <br /> <br /> <a href="http://img604.imageshack.us/content.php?page=blogpost&files=img233/8915/iptg4.jpg" title="quickpost"> </a> hope that would help ... do not dwell in the past , do not dream of the future , concentrate the mind on the present moment . <strong> -LRB- gautama buddha -RRB- </strong>
you can hard reset your
you can hard reset your wireless router by pressing the small button at the back with a paper clip , but you will need to re-configure the router - anyway its just username and password for the adsl setting you just have to obtain that information before doing the hard reset . <a title="everything you need to know about living in doha, qatar" href="http://www.qatarliving.com"> <img src="http://static.qatarliving.com/badges/150x50_ql_glass_badge.gif" alt="everything you need to know about living in doha, qatar" /> </a>

plumkiwi i dont think there is any problem with the router coz i am using same connection on ma laptop with the same security settings ... wot d u say ?
i didnt say there is problem
i didnt say there is problem with the router . its with the security maybe your pda doesnt authenticate with security encryption better disable it first to verify . or better yet try changing your security mode to `` wep '' encryption `` 10/64-bits '' . <a title="everything you need to know about living in doha, qatar" href="http://www.qatarliving.com"> <img src="http://static.qatarliving.com/badges/150x50_ql_glass_badge.gif" alt="everything you need to know about living in doha, qatar" /> </a>
